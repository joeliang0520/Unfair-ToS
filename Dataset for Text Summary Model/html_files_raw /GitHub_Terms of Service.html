The GitHub Terms of Service
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Effective date: November 16, 2020<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
A.
Definitions
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings.
You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.
There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub.
A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub.
“Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once.
A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.
Most of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>"Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service.
"Content" also includes Services.
“User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users.
"Your Content" is Content that you create or own.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service.
that accesses or uses any part of the Account.
or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions.
A User must be at least 13 years of age.
Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See Section B(5): Additional Terms).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website.
It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com.
These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as githubuniverse.com, and product websites, such as atom.io.
Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service.
If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
B.
Account Terms
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls.
a human must create your Account.
you must be 13 or over.
you must provide a valid email address.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.
Account Controls
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Users.
Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Organizations.
The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it.
Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects.
An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization.
If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
2.
Required Information
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process.
Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.
Account Requirements
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub's Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must be a human to create an Account.
Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
We do permit machine accounts:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions.
A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.
Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.
You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">You must be age 13 or older.
While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law.
GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.
If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="233" data-revision="latest" data-offset="9912">
If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older.
in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.
A paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.
You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S.
government agency.
GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S.
government authorizations.
For more information, please see our Export Controls policy.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
4.
User Account Security
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
5.
Additional Terms
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub.
For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements.
you may download an application that integrates with GitHub.
or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service.
Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
C.
Acceptable Use
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith.
While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations.
In short, be excellent to each other.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction.
You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
D.
User-Generated Content
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="233" data-revision="latest" data-offset="13609">
You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.
We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.
Responsibility for User-Generated Content
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.
You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.
We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
2.
GitHub May Remove Content
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies.
User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub for mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.
Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content.
If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post.
that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post.
and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7.
These license grants apply to Your Content.
If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.
You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7.
The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
4.
License Grant to Us
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time.

parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.
share it with other users.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content.
It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
5.
License Grant to Other Users
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/p&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span>
<span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;p&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking).</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="233" data-revision="latest" data-offset="17370">
You may grant further rights if you adopt a license.
If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
6.
Contributions Under Repository License
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms.
If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Isn't this just how it works already? Yep.
This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community.
it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound".
We're just making it explicit.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
7.
Moral Rights
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.
However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
E.
Private Repositories
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.
Control of Private Repositories
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
2.
Confidentiality of Private Repositories
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you.
GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.
Access
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories.
For example:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories.
These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential.
If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
