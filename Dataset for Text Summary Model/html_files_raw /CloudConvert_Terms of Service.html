These terms apply to the entire website and any API usage.
This service is operated by Lunaweb GmbH, Gruenwald (Germany).
We may choose to correct or amend these Terms of Use at any time.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Allowed Usage <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Don't be evil and do bad things with our service.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> This service offers functionality to convert and modify files of different file formats.
This service is provided through web interface, API, and mobile apps.
You agree to comply with the policies and limitations concerning the use of the CloudConvert service, including, without limitation, the maximum consumed time ("conversion minutes") of conversions done through the service, the maximum number of files a user may upload through the service, and the maximum size of the files a user may convert through the service.
You agree not to bypass these policies by any means (e.g., creating multiple accounts).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Packages <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Make a one-time payment.
Packages do not expire.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> By buying a prepaid package you can extend the allowed usage of the service ("conversion minutes").
All payments are one-time prepaid payments and are not refundable.
Prepaid packages will be activated on your account as soon as we receive your payment.
The credits of your package will not expire as long as you do not terminate your account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Subscriptions <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Pay by the month.
Unused credits will expire.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Subscriptions add a monthly credit to your account.
Unused credits will expire at the end of the billing period.
Payments are not refundable.
The subscription will be activated on your account as soon as we receive your payment and will be renewed one month after your payment.
You can cancel your subscription at any time on the CloudConvert website, which will take effect at the end of the billing period.
You can change your subscription to a different plan at any time, but the remaining credits of the current billing period will expire.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Auto Refill Packages <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> You will be charged when 95% of your credits are consumed.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> By enabling the "Auto Refill" option, you agree to be charged your chosen package automatically, if your previous package is consumed by 95%.
You are responsible for monitoring your account to prevent unwanted payments.
The Auto Refill option can be cancelled at any time.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Availability of Service (SLA) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We guarantee 99.99% uptime.
If we fail, you get your money back.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We will use commercially reasonable efforts to make each service available with a monthly uptime percentage of at least <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>99.99%<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The monthly uptime percentage is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which the service is not available.
In the event CloudConvert does not meet this availability, you will be eligible to receive a refund as described below.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Refunds <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> In the event of noncompliance, you get 1% of the total amount of the last invoice, per 10 minutes of unavailability, limited to 100% of the total invoice amount.
To receive a refund, you must submit a claim, which contains at least the following information: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the dates and times of each unavailability incident that youâ€™re claiming<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
