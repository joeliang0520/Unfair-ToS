<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cocoon is aimed at providing the best rewards program (“Service”).
As such, it’s worth noting a few major items:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By creating a Cocoon account or Logging In, you acknowledge and agree to Cocoon collecting information on the apps installed on any device the software is installed on.
This information may be used to ensure that Cocoon is able to promote relevant apps and offers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Members are not permitted to attempt “gaming” or “hacking” the Cocoon program in any way.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Members will not, under any circumstances, encourage other members or any other persons to hack or game the Cocoon program including via online blogs, forums, groups, etc.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Members will not post referral links in an attempt to trick members or any other persons through deceptive means, inaccurate descriptions, fake earning opportunities or other questionable methods as determined by the Cocoon staff.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Examples of abuse that Cocoon’s automated technology will flag and will not be tolerated include: extended inactivity, software that attempts to manipulate the program in any way, and app usage anomalies outside of normal behavior patterns.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Violating any of these terms or any of the terms below will mean immediate revocation of earned rewards and potentially means being blacklisted from Cocoon in perpetuity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (“AGREEMENT”) GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cocoon is pleased to provide and maintain our product (the ” Software”).
Except as otherwise indicated by Cocoon, the Software includes the Cocoon mobile apps, tablet apps and any other versions of our product and any updates, new versions or new releases of the product.
Cocoon’s software also includes the desktop web browser for Windows and Macintosh.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cocoon’s browser is built on the Chromium Open Source project.
More about Chromium and the copyrights and conditions can be learned about here: http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/LICENSE<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Your relationship with Cocoon<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your use of Cocoon’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Cocoon under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Cocoon.
“Cocoon” refers to Virtual World Computing, whose principal place of business is at 5425 Hollister Ave, Ste 160, Santa Barbara, CA 93111, United States.
This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Cocoon, your agreement with Cocoon will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document.
These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”.
Open source software licenses for Cocoon browser source code constitute separate written agreements.
To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Cocoon for the use of Cocoon browser or specific included components of Cocoon.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your agreement with Cocoon will also include the terms set forth below in the Cocoon browser Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms.
All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”.
Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Cocoon in relation to your use of the Services.
It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.
Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Accepting the Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms.
You may not use the Services if you do not accept the Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You can accept the Terms by:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(B) by actually using the Services.
In this case, you understand and agree that Cocoon will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Language of the Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Where Cocoon has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, then you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language versions of the Terms will govern your relationship with Cocoon.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If there is any contradiction between what the English language version of the Terms says and what a translation says, then the English language version shall take precedence.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
