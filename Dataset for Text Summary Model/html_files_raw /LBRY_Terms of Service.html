Overview of LBRY and the Services <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“LBRY”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> is a decentralized, consensus-driven protocol that enables the publication and viewing of information, videos, music, data and other materials (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“Content”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>).
Content is distributed to LBRY by publishers and is stored in fragmented shards via a distributed network of third-party devices (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“Hosts”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) that utilize LBRY.
LBRY also allows publishers to bid on and reserve names (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“Names”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>), which can be used as a unique identifier for Content.
Please consult lbry.tech to learn more about the technical architecture of LBRY.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Services provide an interface for you to interact with LBRY, including to publish, access, or host Content through LBRY.

We are not able to delete or remove Content that has been published through LBRY and that may be accessible via the Services.

Dispute Resolution.
Arbitration <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

Binding Arbitration <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“Disputes”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company (a) waive your and the Company’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and the Company’s respective rights to a jury trial.

There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.
Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 17.3.
Federal Arbitration Act <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 16 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.

Notice.
Informal Dispute Resolution <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.
Notice to the Company will be sent by e-mail to the Company at hello@lbry.com Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account.
Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.
If you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 16, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 16.1, file a claim in court.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 17.5.
Process <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware.
Arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“JAMS”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>), which are hereby incorporated by reference.
The state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.
You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 17.6.
Authority of Arbitrator <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.
The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 17.7.
Rules of JAMS <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website.
By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 18.
