<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates.
(b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service.
or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.
Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content from the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Downloadable Software<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), you give permission for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to your device settings.
Unless that software is governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service.
This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement.
You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Open Source<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you.
There may be provisions in an open source license that expressly override some of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.
