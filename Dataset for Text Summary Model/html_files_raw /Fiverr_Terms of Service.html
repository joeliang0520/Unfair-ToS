We are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Gigs on Fiverr may be offered at a base starting price of $5.
Some Gigs are offered at a base price of more than $5 as determined by the Seller.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Buyers pay Fiverr in advance to create an order (see Payment Terms).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Orders are purchased through the Order button found on a Seller’s Gig page or through a Custom Offer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>For fees and payments please read the Payment Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers must fulfill their orders, and may not cancel orders on a regular basis or without cause.
Cancelling orders will affect Sellers’ reputation and status.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers gain account statuses (Levels) based on their performance and reputation.
Advanced levels provide their owners with benefits, including offering services for higher prices through Gig Extras, or selling their Gig in multiples.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Users may not offer or accept payments using any method other than placing an order through Fiverr.com.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When purchasing a Gig, Buyers are granted all rights for the delivered work, unless otherwise specified by the Seller on their Gig page.
Note: some Gigs charge additional payments (through Gig Extras) for Commercial Use License.
See our “Ownership” and “Commercial Use License” sections below for more information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr retains the right to use all published delivered works and Logo Designs for Fiverr marketing and promotion purposes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We care about your privacy.
You can read our Privacy Policy here.
The Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms of Service and incorporated herein by reference.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Users undertake to comply with Fiverr’s Community Standards, which are a set of behavior rules and guidelines, applicable to the Fiverr community and marketplace in addition to these Terms of Service, as updated from time to time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr offers its users the Logo Maker, which allows certain Sellers to offer various original logo designs for Buyers to adjust and customize per their own specific needs, using special automated design tools.
Through the Logo Maker, Buyers purchase full commercial use rights to the Logo Design embedded with their brand name.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Sellers Basics <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers create Gigs on Fiverr to allow Buyers to purchase their services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers may also offer Custom Offers to Buyers in addition to their Gigs.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Each Gig you sell and successfully complete, accredits your account with a revenue equal to 80% of the purchase amount.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr accredits Sellers once an order is completed.
See our "Orders" section below for a definition of a completed order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>For more information about receiving payments, fees and taxes see the Payment Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers may not promote their Gigs or any Fiverr content via the Google Ads platform.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Seller's rating is calculated based on the order reviews posted by Buyers or Business Account Team Members.
High ratings allow Sellers to obtain advanced Seller levels (see Levels below).
In certain cases, exceedingly low ratings may lead to the suspension of the Seller’s account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>For security concerns, Fiverr may temporarily disable a Seller’s ability to withdraw revenue to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity.
This may come as a result of security issues, improper behavior reported by other users, or associating multiple Fiverr accounts to a single withdrawal provider.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers are responsible for obtaining a general liability insurance policy with coverage amounts that are sufficient to cover all risks associated with the performance of their services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>

An option to upload two additional Gig images are available to all Sellers.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Certain categories are available only to Pro Sellers to create Gigs.
If you are not a Pro Seller, creating a Gig for services available to Pro only may result in removal of your Gig.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Gig® Extras <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Gig Extras are additional services offered on top of the Seller’s Gig for an additional price defined by the Seller.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

Gigs are subject to be removed due to violations found in Gig Extras.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The amount of Gig Extras, which can be offered, and the price for each Gig Extra, is based on your Seller Level.
More information surrounding your accounts eligibility for Gig Extras can be found here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Services offered through Gig Extras must be related to the base service and part of the deliverables on the Order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Gig Extras may cover different categories of services that are components to a higher quality delivered service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers have the option to extend the duration of an Order for each Gig Extra that is added to the Order.
This is to cover the time needed to complete the extra service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Levels <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Fiverr is all about helping Sellers leverage their skills.
We seek to empower top performing Sellers with helpful tools to grow their business.
Sellers who invest in self-promotion may achieve greater customer satisfaction.
And, if they deliver on time and maintain high quality and ratings, Fiverr may reward them with new statuses, special opportunities, benefits, and tools that come with it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr Sellers can gain account Levels based on their activity, performance and reputation.
The advancement criteria can be found here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Advancement in Levels are updated periodically by an automated system.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The current Levels a Seller can achieve are, Level 1, 2, and Top Rated.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers who cannot maintain their high quality service, experience a severe drop in ratings, or stop delivering on time risk losing their Seller status and the benefits that come with it.
For example, late deliveries, warnings to the Seller’s account and cancellations can cause a Seller to move to a different Level.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Advanced levels provide their owners with additional benefits, including offering Gigs for higher prices through Gig Extras, or selling their Gig in multiples.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Top Rated Sellers <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Top Rated Sellers are chosen manually by Fiverr editors through an ongoing review process based on seniority, volume of sales, extremely high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and community leadership.
Top Rated Sellers gain access to more extensive features than previous levels, including exclusive access to beta features and VIP support.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Top Rated eligibility is constantly evaluated by Fiverr to ensure that the quality standards and expectations of the Top Rated selection is kept.
Fiverr retains the right to change a Top Rated Seller status in light of such evaluation.
In addition, Top Rated Sellers who cannot maintain their high quality service through a severe drop in ratings, stop delivering on time, increased cancellation rate or violate our Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards, also risk losing their Top Rated status and the benefits that come with it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Pro Sellers <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Pro Sellers are pre-verified professionals who undergo a vetting process by Fiverr editors.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Pro Sellers eligibility is constantly evaluated by Fiverr to ensure that the quality standards and expectations of the Pro Seller selection is kept.
Fiverr retains the right to change a Pro Seller status in light of such evaluation.
In addition, Pro Sellers who cannot maintain their high quality service through a severe drop in ratings, stop delivering on time, increased cancellation rate or violate our Terms of Service, also risk losing their Pro status and the benefits that come with it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Seller Features <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Fiverr Sellers have access to several exclusive features that help customize the way their services can be offered.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Custom Offer <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers can also send Custom Offers addressing specific requirements of a Buyer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Custom Offers are defined by the Seller with the exact description of the service, the price and the time expected to deliver the service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Custom Offers are sent from the conversation page.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Services provided through Custom Offers may not violate Fiverr’s Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Project Milestones: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Custom Offers above $100 may include up to six project milestones, the minimum amount for each milestone is $50 and the project should include at least two milestones.
Each milestone is paid and delivered separately in accordance with each Custom Offer’s description and timelines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Once a milestone is delivered and marked as completed, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or to stop the Order.
If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of previous milestones, the order of the next milestone will not start.
A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8 days after marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all further milestones will not be started.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Fiverr Studios <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A Fiverr Studio allows certain Sellers to collaborate with each other and offer Buyers a multi-service Gig (a "Studio Gig").<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Studio Lead: Certain selected Sellers may lead and operate Fiverr Studios as Studio Leads.
Studio Leads are chosen manually by Fiverr editors through an ongoing review process based on seniority, volume of sales, high ratings, exceptional customer care, high order completion rate and more.
The Studio Lead is responsible for inviting all Studio Members and managing all incoming Orders, from communicating with the Buyer, through handling any required revisions and until the final delivery.
The Studio Lead can also remove Studio Members from Studio Gigs at any time.
With respect to open Orders, however, Studio Members can be removed by Customer Support only.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Studio Members: A Studio Lead can invite other Sellers who were also chosen by Fiverr to be eligible for Studios collaboration (each, a "Studio Member") to join their Studio Gig and be assigned to a specific service.
Studio Members can ask to be removed from a Studio Gig at any time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Studio Gigs: A Studio Gig provides a bundle of services (from two services and up to five) within one Gig.
A Studio Gig’s minimum price is US$100.
As Studio Gig is comprised of several services, every service includes its own pricing, pricing factors, and a Studio Member / Lead that is accountable for such service, all of which is defined by the Studio Lead when creating the Studio Gig.
Fiverr Studios may also offer Custom Offers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Limitations: Each Fiverr Studio has one Studio Lead.
Similarly, a Studio Lead may not operate more than one Fiverr Studio.
A Fiverr Studio can offer up to five Studio Gigs, each comprised of up to four Studio Members in addition to the Studio Lead.
Studio Members may not be assigned to more than three Studio Gigs.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Studio Gig Reviews: Studio Gig Buyers are able to leave a public review on the Studio Gig as if it were a regular Gig.
The public buying rating &amp;amp.
review is linked to and visible on the Studio Gig page, the Fiverr Studio itself (studio page), as well as all Studio Members and Studio Lead of that Fiverr Studio.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Fiverr Anywhere <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr Anywhere is a feature that allows Sellers to send Custom Offers outside of Fiverr.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Services offered through Fiverr Anywhere must comply with our Terms of Service and our Community Standards.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Users accessing and purchasing from a Fiverr Anywhere offer that are not already members of Fiverr, will be required to register with Fiverr to create an Order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers are required to deliver proof of completion of services in the Order Page.
Please see our Orders section for further details.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Communication for handling Orders should be performed on Fiverr, through the Order Page.
Users who engage and communicate off of Fiverr will not be protected by our Terms of Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Stock Images <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Eligible Gigs have the option to use Stock Images.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“Stock Images” is a Gig Extra that allows Sellers to choose from an exclusive catalog of images as part of the final delivery of work.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers earn 25% of revenue from the Stock Images Extra, for completed orders only.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Important: Each selected Stock Image is authorized for a one time use.
The selected image is integrated with the delivered work only and not as a stand-alone or for recurring use.
Sellers are unauthorized to share the original image file with the Buyer or any third party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Important: If you cancel an Order that includes a Stock Image, the usage of that Stock Image will be cancelled as well and you will no longer be able to use the Stock Image Extra on the same Order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All Stock Images are licensed by GettyImages®, who has full ownership and copyrights to the Stock Images provided on Fiverr and shall be responsible for all Stock Images and their quality.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Shipping Physical Deliverables <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some of the services on Fiverr are delivered physically (arts and crafts, collectable items, etc.).
For these types of Gigs, Sellers may decide to add shipping charges.
Sellers can add shipping charges for local shipping (within the same country) and for international shipping (anywhere else).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Gigs that include shipping costs must have physical deliverables sent to Buyers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Shipping costs added to a Gig only pertains to the cost Sellers require to ship physical items to Buyers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Important: Buyers who purchase Gigs that require physical delivery, will be asked to provide a shipping address.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers are responsible for all shipping arrangements once the Buyer provides the shipping address.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div> <p></p>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Buyers Basics <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may not offer direct payments to Sellers using payment systems outside of the Fiverr platform.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fiverr retains the right to use all publicly published delivered works for Fiverr marketing and promotional purposes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Buyers may request a specific service from the Post a Request feature.
Services requested on Fiverr must be an allowed service on Fiverr.
Please click here for guidelines on approved services.
Users should refrain from using the Post a Request feature for any purpose other than looking for services on Fiverr.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Purchasing <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Please refer to the Payment Terms for making Payments through the Fiverr platform and to learn about fees and taxes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In addition, Buyers can request a Custom Order which addresses specific Buyer requirements, and receive a Custom Offer from Sellers through the site or through Fiverr Anywhere.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may not offer Sellers to pay, or make payment using any method other than through the Fiverr.com site.
In case you have been asked to use an alternative payment method, please report it immediately to Customer Support here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Orders Basics <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Once payment is confirmed, your order will be created and given a unique Fiverr order number (#FO).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers must deliver completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Work button (located on the Order page) according to the service that was purchased and advertised on their Gig.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Deliver Work button may not be abused by Sellers to circumvent Order guidelines described in these Terms of Service.
Using the “Deliver Work” button when an Order was not fulfilled may result in a cancellation of that Order after review, affect the Seller’s rating and result in a warning to Seller.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>An Order is marked as Complete after it is marked as Delivered and then accepted by a Buyer.
An Order will be automatically marked as Complete if not accepted and no request for modification was submitted within 3 days after the Order was marked as Delivered.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves.
If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact Fiverr's Customer Support department for assistance here.
For more information about disputes, Order cancellations and refunds please refer to the Payment Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Orders through the Logo Maker are completed once payment is made by the Buyer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A milestone (on an Order with milestones) is marked as Complete after it is delivered by the Seller and then accepted by the Buyer.
A milestone will be automatically marked as complete if no acceptance or request for modification were submitted within 8 days after marked as Delivered, however, in such case the Order will be stopped and all further milestones will not start.
Once a milestone is delivered and accepted, Buyers may choose to either continue with the Order and pay for the next milestone, or to stop the Order.
If Buyer does not pay for the next milestone within 10 days of acceptance of previous milestones, the order of the next milestone will not start.
Please note that if you choose to stop the Order, the current ordered milestone will not be cancelled.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Handling Orders <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When a Buyer orders a Gig, the Seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their Gigs.
Failing to do so will allow the Buyer to cancel the Order when an Order is marked as late and may harm the Seller's status.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to mark the Order as Delivered.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Reviews <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Feedback reviews provided by Buyers while completing an Order are an essential part of Fiverr's rating system.
Reviews demonstrate the Buyer's overall experience with the Sellers and their service.
Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the Seller any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the Seller.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Leaving a Buyer's feedback is a basic prerogative of a Buyer.
Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear violations of our Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through the Fiverr platform from users within our Community.
Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance Seller ratings, or to abuse the Fiverr platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Feedback comments given by Buyers are publicly displayed on a Seller’s Gig page.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Work Samples are the delivered images and videos sent to a Buyer in a delivery message.
Work Samples are added to a Seller's Live Portfolio on their Gig page if the Buyer chooses to publish the Work Sample while providing a public feedback review.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the Gig’s service with the intent to gain favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the Buyer has three days to respond.
If no response is provided within the response period, the Order will be considered completed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Users are allowed to leave reviews on Orders up to 10 days after an Order is marked as complete.
No new reviews may be added to an Order after 10 days.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Sellers may not solicit the removal of feedback reviews from their Buyers through mutual cancellations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Feedback reviews are unavailable for orders made through the Logo Maker.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Disputes and Cancellations We encourage our Buyers and Sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves.
If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact Fiverr's Customer Support department for assistance here.
