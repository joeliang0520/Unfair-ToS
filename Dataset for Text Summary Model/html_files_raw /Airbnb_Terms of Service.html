<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Thank you for using Airbnb!<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms of Service (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Airbnb Platform<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
When used in these Terms, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>we<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>us<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” or “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>our<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” refers to the Airbnb entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Members<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.
Members who publish and offer services are “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Hosts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Guests<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.” Hosts offer accommodations (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Accommodations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), activities, excursions, and events (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Experiences<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Host Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” and each Host Service offering, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Listing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You must register an account to access and use many features of the Airbnb Platform, and must keep your account information accurate.
As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services.
Airbnb is not a party to the contracts concluded directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker or insurer.
Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
To learn more about Airbnb’s role see Section 16.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the Airbnb payment entities ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Airbnb Payments<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>").

Our Mission<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Our mission is to create a world where you can belong anywhere.
From cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to travel.
Learn more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile, and Guest reviews.
If you have questions, just message the Host.

Searching and Booking on Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.1 Searching<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.
You can also use filters to refine your search results.
Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.
Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g.
minimum or maximum nights), and more.
Learn more about search results in our Help Center.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.2 Booking<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Total Price<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You are also agreeing that Airbnb Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout.
When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host.
The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host.
Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.3 Accommodation Reservations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
An Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation.
The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law.
If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties.
You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
An Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service.
You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements.
You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Host Service.
Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.
But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">If something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="527" data-revision="latest" data-offset="8308">
If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the Guest Refund Policy.
Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings.
for example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy.
See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>3.2 Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>4.
Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>4.1 Your Responsibilities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service.
For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times.
If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online.
This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you.
For example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Host Terms
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.
Hosting on Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.1 Host<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
As a Host, Airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it.
It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.2 Contracting with Guests<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing.
You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking.
Airbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.
Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.3 Independence of Hosts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Your relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms.
Airbnb does not direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

Managing Your Listing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing.
Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing.
You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.
We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions.
You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.
Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services.
For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays.
Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties.
Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle).
In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether.
Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation.
Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts.
For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays.
Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer.
Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations.
You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards.
If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.3 Search Ranking<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The ranking of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest search parameters (e.g.
number of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Listing characteristics (e.g.
price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest booking experience (e.g.
customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking), <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Host requirements (e.g.
minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest preferences (e.g.
previous trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website.
Airbnb may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform by paying an additional fee.
More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.4 Your Responsibilities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services.
You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing.
You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Airbnb Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy.
Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Airbnb Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms.
If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.
If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions.
If you instruct Airbnb to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.6 Your Assumption of Risk<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online.
You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Airbnb Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Airbnb.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>7.
Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.
As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law.
If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.
If: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.
If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Airbnb exceeds your payout, Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts.
You agree that Airbnb’s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests.
If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made.
If you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your reservations.
See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>7.2 Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>8.1 Host Taxes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
As a host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Taxes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>").

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>8.2 Collection and Remittance by Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority.
Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Airbnb are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable.
Airbnb may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Airbnb is a refund from the applicable Tax authority.
You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>8.3 Tax Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both.
If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided.
You agree that Airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by you, our Guests, and/or their organizations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>General Terms

By providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Airbnb a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable and transferable license to copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that Content, without limitation.
If Content includes personal information, our Privacy Policy describes how we use that personal information.
Where Airbnb pays for the creation of Content or facilitates its creation, Airbnb may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that.
You are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant Airbnb the rights described in these Terms.
You are responsible and liable if any of your Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party.
Content must comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content.
You agree that Airbnb may make available services or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools.
Airbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services.
While we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Airbnb, we do not and cannot control the conduct of Guests and Hosts.
You acknowledge that Airbnb has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor the use of the Airbnb Platform and verify information provided by our Members.
For example, we may review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Airbnb Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes).
(ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms.
(iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body.
(iv) address Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable.
(v) take actions set out in these Terms.
and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria.
Members acknowledge and agree that Airbnb administers its Policies (such as our Extenuating Circumstances Policy) and Standards (such as basic requirements for hosts), including decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular situation, at its sole discretion.
Members agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the Airbnb Platform.
Airbnb is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Airbnb Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up-to-date.
You may not register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party.
You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your account and must immediately notify Airbnb if you suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised.
If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

(ii) we do not warrant the performance or non-interruption of the Airbnb Platform.
and (iii) we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Listings or Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct.
Any references to a Member or Listing being "verified" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Listing or Airbnb has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else.
The disclaimers in these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.
If you have statutory rights or warranties we cannot disclaim, the duration of any such statutorily required rights or warranties, will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Except for our obligation to transmit payments to Hosts under these Terms, or make payments under the Airbnb Host Guarantee or Japan Host Insurance, in no event will Airbnb’s aggregate liability for any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your interaction with any Members, or your use of or inability to use the Airbnb Platform, any Content, or any Host Service, exceed: (A) to Guests, the amount you paid as a Guest during the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, (B) to Hosts, the amount paid to you as a Host in the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or (C) to anyone else, one hundred U.S.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Airbnb’s option), indemnify, and hold Airbnb (including Airbnb Payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your breach of these Terms (including any supplemental or additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the Airbnb Platform, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience or other Host Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to accurately report, collect or remit Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights such as intellectual property or privacy rights.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

Contracting Entities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on the Airbnb Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the Airbnb entity with whom you are contracting.
If we identify through the Airbnb Platform, an Airbnb entity other than the one set out on Schedule 1 as being responsible for a product, feature or transaction, the Airbnb entity so identified is your contracting entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction.
If you change your country of residence or establishment, the Airbnb company you contract with (as set out on Schedule 1) and the applicable version of the Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

United States Governing Law and Venue<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you reside or have your place of establishment in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions.
Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement in Section 23 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location.
You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

United States Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.1 Application<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States.
If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Airbnb in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section 23 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Airbnb is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process.
To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Section 23 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Airbnb’s customer service team (described in paragraph 23.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You and Airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
At least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Airbnb each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution.
You must send your notice of dispute to Airbnb by mailing it to Airbnb’s agent for service: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>CSC Lawyers Incorporating Service, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Airbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Airbnb account.
A notice of dispute must include: the party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at www.adr.org).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.4 Agreement to Arbitrate<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You and Airbnb mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Airbnb Platform, Host Services, or any Content (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Disputes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>”).
If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
(ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).
or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief.
You and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>“) then in effect, except as modified here.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org.
In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at www.adr.org) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Airbnb agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S.
county where you reside.
(b) in San Francisco County.
(c) via phone or video conference.
or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Airbnb will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.9 Arbitrator’s Decision<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.10 Jury Trial Waiver<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding.
Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.12 Severability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Except as provided in Section 23.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
If Airbnb changes this Section 23 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective.
Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Airbnb.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>23.14 Survival<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Except as provided in Section 23.12 and subject to Section 13.6, this Section 23 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Airbnb Platform or terminate your Airbnb account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Thank you for using Airbnb!<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms of Service for European Users (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Airbnb Platform<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
When used in these Terms, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>we<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>us<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” or “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>our<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” refers to the Airbnb entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Members<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.
Members who publish and offer services are “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Hosts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Guests<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.” Hosts offer accommodations (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Accommodations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), activities, excursions and events (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Experiences<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Host Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” and each Host Service offering, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Listing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You must register an account to access and use many features of the Airbnb Platform, and must keep your account information accurate.
As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services.
Airbnb is not a party to the contracts concluded directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302.
Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).

Learn more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile, and past Guest reviews.
If you have questions, just message the Host.

Searching and Booking on Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.1 Searching<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.
You can also use filters to refine your search results.
Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.
Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g.
minimum or maximum nights), and more.
Learn more about search results in our Help Center.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.2 Booking<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Total Price<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You are also agreeing that Airbnb Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout.
When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host.
The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host.
Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.3 Accommodation Reservations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
An Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation.
The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law.
If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties.
You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
An Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service.
You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements.
You are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use the Host Service.
Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In general, if you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.
But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you.
If something outside your control requires you to cancel a reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.
If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under our Guest Refund Policy.
Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings.
for example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy.
See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.
You may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>3.2 Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Hosts and Guests are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>4.
Your Responsibilities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation or Experience.
For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect and comply with applicable laws at all times.
If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Hosting on Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.1 Host<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
As a Host, Airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it.
It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.2 Contracting with Guests<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering the Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing.
You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking.
Airbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.
Any terms or conditions that you include in any supplement contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.3 Independence of Hosts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Your relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms.
Airbnb does not direct or control your Host Service and you understand that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services and at what price and on what terms to offer them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing.
Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing.
You are responsible for your acts and omissions as well as for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.
We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions like coverage details and exclusions.
You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.
Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services.
For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays.
Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties.
Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours or operating a vehicle).
In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether.
Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation.
Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts.
For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays.
Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer.
Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations.
You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards.
If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.3 Search Ranking<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The ranking of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest search parameters (e.g.
number of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Listing characteristics (e.g.
price, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest booking experience (e.g.
customer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking), <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Host requirements (e.g.
minimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Guest preferences (e.g.
previous trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website.
Airbnb may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform by paying an additional fee.
More information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any) and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.4 Your Responsibilities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services.
You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing.
You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Airbnb Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy.
Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Airbnb Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
If you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services, is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms.
If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.
If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions.
If you instruct Airbnb to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.
As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law.
If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.
If: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.
If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Airbnb exceeds your payout, Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts.
You agree that Airbnb’s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests.
If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made.
If you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your reservations.
See each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.
You may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>7.2 Booking Modifications<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Hosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

As a host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income or other taxes ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Taxes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>").
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>8.2 Collection and Remittance by Airbnb<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority.
Any Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Airbnb are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable.
Airbnb may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members’ tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Airbnb is a refund from the applicable Tax authority.
You acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>8.3 Tax Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both.
If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided.
You agree that Airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by our Guests and their organizations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>General Terms

Reviews<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to review each other.
Your Review must be accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our Content Policy or Review Policy.
Reviews are not verified by Airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.

Airbnb may terminate this agreement for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice via email or using any other contact information you have provided for your account.
Airbnb may also terminate this agreement immediately and without prior notice and stop providing access to the Airbnb Platform if (i) you materially breach these Terms or our Policies, (ii) you violate applicable laws, or (iii) such action is necessary to protect the personal safety or property of Airbnb, its Members, or third parties (for example in the case of fraudulent behavior of a Member), or (iv) your account has been inactive for more than two years.

Resolving Complaints and Damage Claims<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

If the complaining Member escalates a Damage Claim to Airbnb, the other Member will be given an opportunity to respond.
If the responding Member agrees to pay, or Airbnb determines under consideration of any applicable statutory rules on the burden of proof that they are responsible for the Damage Claim, Airbnb via Airbnb Payments can collect any sums required to cover the Damage Claim from the responding Member and/or against any security deposit.
Airbnb may also pursue against you any remedies it may have available under applicable law.
You agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information Airbnb requests, execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in connection with Damage Claims, Member complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other claims related to your provision or use of Host Services.
You may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.
Any decisions made by Airbnb in relation to a Damage Claim do not affect your contractual and statutory rights.
Your right to take legal action before a court of law remains unaffected.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>16.
Airbnb’s Role<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search for, and book Host Services.
When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other.
Airbnb is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members.
Airbnb is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Airbnb Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.
While we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Airbnb, we do not and cannot control the conduct or performance of Guests and Hosts and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services or (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Reviews, or other Content provided by Members.
You acknowledge that Airbnb has no general obligation to monitor the use of the Airbnb Platform and verify information provided by our Members, but has the right to review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Airbnb Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes).
(ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms.
(iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body.
(iv) address Member Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable.
(v) take actions set out in these Terms.
and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria.
Where we remove or disable Content, we will notify a Member and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other Members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable laws.
You may appeal such a decision by contacting our customer service.
Members agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the Airbnb Platform.

Member Accounts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must register an account to access and use many features of the Airbnb Platform.
Registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and natural persons who are 18 years or older.
You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity barred from using the Airbnb Platform under the laws of the United States, your place of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction.
You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up-to-date.
You may not register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party.
You must immediately notify Airbnb if you suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised.
You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your Airbnb Account, unless such activities are not authorized by you and you are not otherwise negligent (such as failing to report the unauthorized use or loss of your credentials).
If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Disclaimer<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>We do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance, safety, quality, legality or suitability of any Guest, Host, Host Service, Listing or third party and we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct.
Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Airbnb has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else.
We are not responsible for outages or disruptions of the Internet and telecommunications infrastructure which are beyond our control and can lead to interruptions in the availability of the Airbnb Platform.
Airbnb may, temporarily and under consideration of the Members’ legitimate interests (e.g.
by providing prior notice), restrict the availability of the Airbnb Platform or certain features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the Airbnb Platform.

Liability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Airbnb is liable under statutory provisions for intent and gross negligence by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents.
The same applies to the assumption of guarantees or any other strict liability, or in case of a culpable injury to life, limb, or health.
For any negligent breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents Airbnb’s liability is limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damages.
Essential contractual obligations are such duties of Airbnb in whose proper fulfillment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract.
Any additional liability of Airbnb is excluded.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Indemnification<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Airbnb’s option), indemnify, and hold Airbnb (including Airbnb Payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your breach of these Terms (including any supplemental or additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or our Policies or Standards, (ii) your improper use of the Airbnb Platform, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience or other Host Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to accurately report, collect or remit Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third party rights such as intellectual property or privacy rights.
The indemnification obligation only applies if and to the extent that the claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses have been adequately caused by your culpable breach of a contractual obligation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>21.
Contracting Entities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on the Airbnb Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the Airbnb entity with whom you are contracting.
If we identify through the Airbnb Platform, an Airbnb entity other than the one set out on Schedule 1 as being responsible for a product, feature or transaction, the Airbnb entity so identified is your contracting entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction.
If you change your country of residence or establishment to a country outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, the Airbnb company you contract with and the applicable version of the Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>22.
Applicable law and Jurisdiction<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with Irish law.
If you are acting as a consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Irish law.
As a consumer, you may bring any judicial proceedings relating to these Terms before the competent court of your place of residence or the competent court of Airbnb's place of business in Ireland.
If Airbnb wishes to enforce any of its rights against you as a consumer, we may do so only in the courts of the jurisdiction in which you are a resident.
If you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

United States Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.1 Application<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
This Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States.
If your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Airbnb in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section 24 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Airbnb is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process.
To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Section 24 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Airbnb’s customer service team (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You and Airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
At least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Airbnb each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution.
You must send your notice of dispute to Airbnb by mailing it to Airbnb’s agent for service: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>CSC Lawyers Incorporating Service, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Airbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Airbnb account.
A notice of dispute must include: the party’s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought.
If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at www.adr.org).&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.4 Agreement to Arbitrate<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You and Airbnb mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Airbnb Platform, Host Services, or any Content (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Disputes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>”) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>”).
If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22 of the Terms of Service for Non-European Users): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
(ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).
or (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief.
You and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
This Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision.
The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>“) then in effect, except as modified here.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org.
In order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at www.adr.org) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
In order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Airbnb agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S.
county where you reside.
(b) in San Francisco County.
(c) via phone or video conference.
or (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney’s Fees and Costs<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.
If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Airbnb will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.
Either party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.9 Arbitrator’s Decision<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.
Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.
The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.10 Jury Trial Waiver<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding.
Unless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.
If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.12 Severability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Except as provided in Section 24.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
If Airbnb changes this Section 24 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective.
Rejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Airbnb.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>24.14 Survival<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
Except as provided in Section 24.12, and subject to Section 13.6 of the Terms of Service for Non-European Users this Section 24 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Airbnb Platform or terminate your Airbnb Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Additional Terms Applicable to Business Users
