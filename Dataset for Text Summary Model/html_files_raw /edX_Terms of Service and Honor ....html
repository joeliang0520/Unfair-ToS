SERVICESGenerally.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>From time to time, edX and the colleges, universities, and other institutions providing courses and programs on the edX Site (collectively, the "Members") may offer services and products for a fee (for example, course and program certificates).
For anything that you choose to purchase on the edX Site, you agree to pay all applicable fees when due.
As described in the Privacy Policy, the processing of your payment information is done by a third-party payment vendor, and you will be routed to a secure payment flow controlled by that vendor to complete the payment transaction.
Once your payment transaction is completed, an edX confirmation page will be displayed, and you will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number, and the payment amount.
Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from edX, as described below.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Certificates.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>edX and the Members may offer Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a "Verified Certificate") or certificates for programs (for example, a MicroMasters program certificate) for learners who, in the Members’ judgment, have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the course or program material.
Certificates will be issued by edX under the name of the underlying Member(s) from where the course or program originated, i.e.
HarvardX, MITx, etc.
The decision whether a certificate will be awarded to a given learner will be solely within the discretion of the awarding Member.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Subject to the foregoing, you will be required to pay a fee and complete the ID verification process for Verified Certificates.
In order to authenticate your identity for a Verified Certificate, you will be prompted to take a webcam photo of yourself, as well as a photo of an acceptable form of photo ID (described below).
Although these items are collected by edX in accordance with these TOS and the Privacy Policy, you should be aware that the actual authentication of your identity is performed by an edX third-party service provider and this information will be used only for the purpose of verifying your identity.
Acceptable forms of photo ID’s are:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Government or State-issued driver's license<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Passport<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>National ID card<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>State or Province ID card (including cards issued by motor vehicle agencies)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order to be accepted by edX, your photo ID must:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Contain your full name exactly (excluding hyphens, accents, and spaces);<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Contain a relatively current photograph of yourself;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Be an original document.
photocopied documents cannot be accepted.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Be current and valid.
expired documents cannot be accepted.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Unfortunately, if you do not possess a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, edX is unable to provide you with a Verified Certificate at this time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Refunds.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Certificates and other purchases on the edX Site may be eligible for a refund for a period of time (in each case, the “Refund Period”).
The applicable Refund Period for some products and services are described below.
To receive a refund during the Refund Period, simply unenroll from the course and the refund will be processed automatically.
Refunds will be credited to the payment account used for the purchase and may take up to two billing cycles to process.
For more info, visit the edX Help Center.
If the applicable Refund Period for a purchase has passed, but you believe a refund is warranted, please submit a support ticket via the Contact us form.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Verified Certificate Track:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To receive a refund with respect to your enrollment in the verified certificate track of a course, you have a period of 14 days after your payment or 14 days after your course starts (up to six months after your payment) whichever occurs later, during which you may withdraw or unenroll from the course by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Professional Education Courses:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To receive a refund with respect to your enrollment in a Professional Education course, you have a period of 2 days after your payment or 2 days after the course starts (up to six months after your payment) whichever occurs later to unenroll from the course by clicking on the unenroll link on the learner dashboard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
