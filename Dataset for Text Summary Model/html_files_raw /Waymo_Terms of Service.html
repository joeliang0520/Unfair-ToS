Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>12.

If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which says “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>13.

Miscellaneous<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The failure of Waymo to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
