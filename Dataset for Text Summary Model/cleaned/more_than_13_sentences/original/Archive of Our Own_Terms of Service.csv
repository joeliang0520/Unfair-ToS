"The otw has no control over such sites or their terms of use or privacy policies, and you agree that the otw is not responsible for and does not endorse their content, terms or availability."
Nothing in this agreement changes that in any way.
"We need such consent because your purpose in and reason for uploading content to the archive is for that content to be visible to users, and if you opt to, for it to be visible to the general public. you consent to our collection, processing and retention of your content, and personal information connected therewith, including display to you and certain archive personnel when you upload a work in ""draft"" form."

"Proposed changes will be prominently disclosed on the service, and we will offer at least a two-week comment period for proposed changes."
"If we receive a complaint about other matters, such as plagiarism or harassment, we will follow the abuse policy, which explains what information provided by the complainant may be disclosed to the subject of the complaint. f. what we will not do: the otw will not provide any third party with any of your personal information or any of the information we collect, except as provided under our terms of service."
"Depending on the type and amount of plagiarized content, this might entail removing an entire piece of content, removing only the plagiarized portions from a longer work while leaving the original material, or adding citations. if you believe a fanwork posted on the archive plagiarizes another work, please report the work to the policy &amp."

To provide you with the content that you are seeking.
"Depending on the nature of the complaint, anonymity of the complainant may hinder our ability to examine and/or verify the complaint."
Content that is harder to avoid (such as comments on the target's fanworks) will be judged more strictly than content that is easily avoidable (such as stories). the behavior of the original poster (the complaint subject) may also affect the team's determination.
"Users engaging in this behavior may be warned, suspended, or permanently suspended as described in the general abuse procedure. when judging whether a specific incident constitutes harassment, the team will consider factors such as whether the behavior was repeated, whether it was repeated after the offender was asked to stop, whether the behavior was targeted at a specific person, whether that target could have easily avoided encountering the behavior, whether the behavior would be considered unacceptable according to normal community standards, etc."
"If we believe that using, retaining and/or sharing that information is necessary to preserve the integrity of the archive and the content that we host."
"You agree to the terms of service archive of our own hosts and shares content created by fans, for fans."
"However, that is not a guarantee that the organization can or will fight each battle."
"Or using an e-mail address or other form of contact associated with a different copy of the fanwork, including on the internet archive."
"Repeated identical or nearly identical posts in multiple places, e.g., a large number of identical comments promoting a website, will also be considered spam regardless of commercial content. anything we determine is spam will be removed immediately."
These can include specific content warnings.
The team's decisions are final unless overturned by the board at the board's sole discretion.
Respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.
"For example, users are able to delete comments on their own stories."
"If the collection's original maintainer decides that they no longer want to be affiliated with the otw, or the otw board decides they no longer wish to work with the original maintainer, the following procedures for dissolution will apply: open doors will delete the imported archive's collection on ao3."
"For these purposes, ""personal information"" may include legal names and other information sufficient to identify a person in the physical world that they have not voluntarily shared on the archive itself."
We or the services we use may store or process your personally identifying information in data centers which may be located in the united states or other countries. we will use your email address internally for purposes of managing ao3 and maintaining site integrity.
Logged-in users who set their preferences to hide information are proceeding at their own risk and may be exposed to content they would otherwise wish to avoid.
"Such users may change their preferences, or reveal information for specific stories, at any time."
"We need such consent because your purpose in and reason for including information in your profile is for that content to be visible to the general public. you consent to our collection, processing, retention and display of text that you submit as comments, as well as your personal information associated therewith."
"For example, you may decide to participate in a challenge run by another user."

Not everyone agrees about what is offensive and unacceptable.
"The current maintainer of the project must agree to the open doors tos, agree to any other conditions of the import, and grant us access to a copy of the current contents of the collection."
"If some but not all of the maintainers later wish to part from the otw, those who wish to do so can continue to work with the collection on the otw servers, while the otw will follow provisions b. and c. for any maintainers who wish to move the collection elsewhere."
B.
"Open doors will work with the original maintainer to delete any unclaimed works. otw will give the original maintainer a copy of the archive backup given to the open doors committee, if available. otw will not be responsible for helping the maintainer set up elsewhere. otw will place an announcement on the open doors page indicating that the original maintainer has moved to a new location, with a link to the new location if provided by the maintainer. these tos are written assuming a single maintainer for a collection."
"If a user affirmatively orphans content, any connection between the user and the work will be removed."
"By submitting content to the archive, you thereby confirm that you are thirteen (13) years old or older (refer to the tos faq). asking a parent or legal guardian to upload content does not constitute submitting content under this policy."
Suspended users retain the right to delete or orphan their fanworks by contacting archive administrators. b. spam and commercial promotion promotion of commercial products or activities is not allowed.
Deleting content is a user's way of withdrawing consent for ao3 to continue hosting said content.

"It therefore may be difficult or even impossible to restore the link between an orphaned content and a user. linking an author with an orphaned work as part of the otw's commitment to privacy, users are not allowed to use comments or tags to publicly identify the creator of an orphaned work after the work has been orphaned."
"Any individual who is between the ages of 13 and 16 and a resident or citizen of a country, including a european economic area country, that states an age that is older than theirs is required to consent to the processing of personal data without our obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian under the gdpr (""age-barred individual"") may not maintain accounts or submit content."

Penalties are not retroactive: a suspended user's nonobjectionable content will not be automatically removed unless the user is an age-barred individual.
