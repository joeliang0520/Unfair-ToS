SERVICES <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;At the time of initial registration, You will select from the list of available Services the service plan(s) to which You wish to subscribe.
All subscriptions to Services are subject to formal acceptance by Vultr.
Your subscription to the Services will be deemed accepted by Vultr when Vultr delivers a confirmation of the subscription to You.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">Vultr reserves the right to refuse to provide You with any Service for any reason.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="4624" data-revision="latest" data-offset="6150">
Notwithstanding Our Uptime Guarantee found in Section 17 of this Agreement, Vultr also reserves the right to interrupt access to the Services to perform regular and emergency maintenance as needed.
You may order additional Services at any time, provided that You agree to pay the then-current fees for such additional Services.
All additional Services shall be considered "Services" hereunder.
All Services provided are subject to availability and to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> More simply put: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We'll notify you right away once your services have been activated! <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Unfortunately, we sometimes have to deny our services or interrupt them for maintenance.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 2.
REVISIONS TO USER AGREEMENT <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> This Agreement contains the complete and entire terms and conditions that apply to Your use of Vultr's Services (as defined below).
Vultr may modify the terms of this Agreement, including the Fees (as defined below) at any time.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From time to time, We may revise this Agreement.
We reserve the right to do so, and You agree that We have this unilateral right.
You agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting.
The updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect.
To the extent any amendment of this Agreement is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, the parties intend that the prior, effective version of this Agreement be considered valid and enforceable to the fullest extent.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.2<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We agree that if We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the "last modified date" at the top of this Agreement.
You agree to periodically re-visit this web page, and to use the "refresh" button on Your browser when doing so.
You agree to note the date of the last revision to this Agreement.
If the "last modified" date remains unchanged from the last time You reviewed this Agreement, then You may presume that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since the last time You read it.
If the "last modified" date has changed, then You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been changed.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.3<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Should You wish to terminate this Agreement due to any revisions made by Us, You must do so in writing via the cancellation form within thirty (30) days of the "last modified" date described above.
Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of any such notice constitutes Your acceptance of such changes.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.4<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Waiver – if You fail to periodically review this Agreement to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for such omission and You agree that such failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms.
We are not responsible for Your neglect of Your legal rights.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> More simply put: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Every so often, we have to update this agreement.
Check the date at the top to see the last time it was revised.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Simply continue to use our services to show us that you accept the changes.

DURATION OF AGREEMENT AND CANCELLATION POLICY <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The Initial Term shall begin upon confirmation of Your order or commencement of the Services to You and receipt of lawful funds.
The term's length is chosen by You and shall be indicated when You order Our Services.
This Agreement may not be terminated by You during the Initial Term (and any renewals thereof) except in the event of a breach by Vultr.
After the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial Term, unless terminated or canceled by either party as provided herein.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.2<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Vultr may also terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time for any reason or no reason.
("Termination without Cause").
In such case, Vultr will provide You with thirty (30) days written notice before the discontinuation of Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.3<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If Vultr cancels this Agreement pursuant to any of the terms outlined in this Agreement, with the exception of Termination without Cause pursuant to paragraph 3.2, Vultr shall not refund to You any fees paid or prepaid in advance of such cancellation and You shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such cancellation.
In the event that Vultr terminates the Agreement for cause, all prepaid hosting fees will be forfeited and are not refundable.
The termination of this Agreement does not relieve You of Your obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to Vultr.com prior to the effective date of termination of this Agreement.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.4<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In addition to Vultr's right to terminate this Agreement provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Vultr may terminate this Agreement effective immediately if, based on Vultr's sole judgment, it determines that You or any of Your end-users: (a) have breached the Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") as described in Section 12 of this Agreement, and incorporated herein, (b) have infringed or violated any intellectual property right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, (c) have not complied with any applicable law, statute or regulation, or (d) have uploaded, published or disseminated any images, text, graphics, code or video which Vultr considers illegal or high risk, in its discretion.
Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to, or shall, impose any duty or obligation upon Vultr to monitor or review Your Content or the content of Your end-users at any time.
You remain solely responsible for Your Content, and any liability generated therefrom.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.5<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The termination of this Agreement will terminate Your access to the Services and Your license to the Host Materials (as defined in Section 5.2 of this Agreement).
Vultr shall not be liable to You or to any third party for termination of the Services permitted under this agreement.
Upon termination of this Agreement, Vultr reserves the right to maintain copies of Your data files and records for archival purposes, but does not undertake any obligation to do so.
Vultr reserves the right to impose an early termination charge for all Services terminated prior to the last day of the billing cycle.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.6<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If either party cancels or terminates this Agreement for any reason, You shall be solely responsible for making all necessary arrangements for securing a replacement host and moving all electronic data, graphics, images, video or text to the new service provider.
Upon termination of this Agreement, provisions that by their nature would be expected to survive termination shall survive and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> More simply put: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We require that you keep your services running until after the initial term.
Vultr reserves the right to cancel your services anytime, but we really don't want to! <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Liabilities resulting from your content is your responsibility.
If we have to cancel this agreement, it is up to you to move your content to another provider.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 4.
ACCOUNT SET UP <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>4.1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When You register for the Services, You will choose a login (email) and password.
You may use the Services or modify Your data and content only through such user ID and password.
You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your user ID and password and for any and all activities which occur using those credentials.
You agree to immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of Your account or any other breach of security known to You.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>4.2<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You must provide Us with a primary email address that is checked regularly and frequently.
All notices and communications between Us will be sent to the email address You provide, and You are therefore required to keep this address current or notify Us if Your address changes.
You should notify Us if any of Your contact and/or billing information changes so that We may update Your account.
It is also Your responsibility to make sure that Our domain(s), vultr.com, are not included in any spam block list used by You or Your mail provider.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>4.3<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Providing false or inaccurate contact information of any kind may result in the Termination for Cause of Your account per Section 3 of this Agreement.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>4.4<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You are responsible for all activity transpiring under Your account.
We therefore highly recommend that You secure file, directory, and script permissions to the most restrictive settings possible.
You agree that You have the technical ability to properly operate a web site and that You are responsible for any actions performed under Your account, including but not limited to, damage caused to Your site, Vultr's site and/or equipment, and any other site.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Please be sure to keep your email address updated too.
We do most of our correspondence over email.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Also, be careful when giving out your account information.
Any activity on your account is your responsibility.

§ 512(f).
Vultr will pursue those who abuse its DMCA notice or counter-notification procedure, and will cooperate with law enforcement in any investigation of such abuse.

Upon receipt of any notification of claimed copyright infringement, Vultr will act expeditiously to notify its customer of the alleged infringement, and take steps to disable or remove the subject material.
DMCA Notices are generally processed within two (2) business days from receipt, absent extenuating circumstances.
Vultr reserves the right at any time to disable access to, or remove any material or expressive work accessible on or from its servers or services, that is claimed to be infringing via a valid DMCA Notice, or based on facts or circumstances from which infringing activity is apparent.
It is the firm policy of Vultr to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers, when appropriate, and Vultr will act expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on another's copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C.
§512 of the DMCA.
The procedure for notifying Vultr of claimed copyright infringement is set forth in Section 7.2, hereof.
If the DMCA notice does not comply with §512 of the DMCA, but does substantially comply with the (3) three requirements for identifying infringing works according to §512 of the DMCA, Vultr shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to reach the complaining party to assist that party comply with sending a compliant DMCA Notice.
As noted above, when Vultr's Designated Agent receives a valid notice, Vultr will act expeditiously to remove and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the affected customer or subscriber.
Then, the affected customer or subscriber may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent, using the counter-notification procedures set forth below.

Affected customers of the DMCA claim may submit a counter-notification to our DMCA agent.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 9.
Counter-Notification Procedures <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> If the Recipient of a Notice of Claimed Infringement ("Notice") believes that the Notice is erroneous or false, and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly removed/disabled in accordance with the procedures outlined above in Section III above, the Recipient is permitted to submit a counter-notification pursuant to 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(g)(2) &amp;amp.
(3).
A counter-notification is the proper method for the Recipient to dispute the improper removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice.
The information that a Recipient provides in a counter-notification must be accurate and truthful, and the Recipient will be liable for any misrepresentations contained in the counter-notification pursuant to 17 U.S.C.
§ 512(f).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span> a statement that the Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in and for the judicial district where the Recipient is located, or if the Recipient is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the Recipient will accept service of process from the person who provided the Notice, or that person's agent.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Within ten to fourteen (10-14) days from Vultr's receipt of a valid counter-notification, Vultr will replace or cease disabling access to the disputed material unless Vultr's Designated Agent receives notification that the original claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the Recipient from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Vultr's system or network.

Accordingly, Vultr requests that any DMCA Notices relating to alleged infringement by third party users, customers or subscribers of Vultr's Service Provider Customers be submitted directly to the DMCA Agent designated by such customer.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> If you have a DMCA claim related to this type of service provider, we ask that you work with them first by sending the DMCA claim to their designated agent.
