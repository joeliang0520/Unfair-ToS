These Terms of Service (hereinafter referred to as "Terms") govern the "Clue" mobile application (referred to as "Clue" or the "Clue App") including all services provided through the Clue App and the Clue website www.helloclue.com ("Clue Services").
The Clue Services are operated by BioWink GmbH, which is located at Adalbertstrasse 7-8, 10999 Berlin (hereinafter referred to as "BioWink" or "we").<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>1.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The Clue Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> provide people with cycles with information and insights about menstrual and reproductive health from menarche to menopause.
Clue is intended to be used as an application on mobile devices.
By tracking the cyclic changes in your body, you can detect patterns, improve your wellbeing, and notice when things are not "normal" for you.
We are always developing new features for different life stages that allow you to understand your body better.
You can find general information about the Clue App as well as different menstrual, sexual and reproductive health and wellbeing topics on the Clue website (details regarding the scope of the services provided through the Clue App are set out under ยง 4 of these Terms).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

By using the Clue Services, you agree to these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>2.2.
We will always ask for your consent to material changes to these Terms if they affect any Paid Services (see ยง 6).
Material changes are changes to the type and scope of the contractually agreed Paid Services, or the duration and termination of the contract.
However, this does not prevent us from improving our services or including additional features or services within the scope of Paid Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>2.3.
We may make non-material amendments to these Terms at any time.
We may implement non-material changes without notice or stating further reasons.
There are no oral or written side agreements under these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The Clue Services are not intended to provide medical advice.
For medical advice that addresses your specific, individual needs, please always consult a qualified healthcare professional.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>When using Clue Services, you agree to use the respective service only for the intended purposes as described in these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>3.2.
Clue is no substitute for a consultation with your healthcare provider, and the use of the Clue Services is at your own risk.
Specific medical conditions can only be diagnosed and treated properly by a qualified healthcare professional.
If you feel that the use of the Clue Services causes you any physical or mental distress, please stop using them and seek medical help.
We cannot give you medical advice, but if you have any complaint, comment or feedback on the Clue Services, you can reach out to us: go to the More menu and then select Support to submit a question or comment to our Clue Support team.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>ยง 4 General scope of services of Clue, Clue Plus and other Clue Premium Features<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>4.1.
Clue is designed to provide general information about menstrual and reproductive health and related topics.
The app collects the data you enter, for example on menstrual cycles, physical activities, health and medications, pregnancy, and other data about the body.
These data allow statistical and algorithmic data processing that can show you patterns in your menstrual cycle or pregnancy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>4.2.
Clue is a self-management app.
This means that Clue's services are based on the data that you provide, so the information and analysis available in the app depends on the amount and accuracy of the inputs you choose to record.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>4.3.
Clue is intended for use on iOS and Android mobile devices in the following app versions:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(a) Usage with an account (requiring registration): In this case, the data is stored both locally on your mobile phone and on our servers, so that the service can be used on multiple logged-in devices ( <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Clue as an online service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> ).
Further details regarding the registration process can be found in ยง 5 of these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(b) Usage without creating an account (without registration): In this case, the data is only stored locally on the memory of your mobile phone ( <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Clue as a local service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> ) - this service is no longer available to new users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>4.4.
Clue offers some functions and content free of charge ( <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Clue", or the "basic" Clue App), while access to more extensive functions and content is paid (the "Paid Services", see ยง 6 below).
The basic Clue app can be acquired free of charge from the relevant app store (if you have an iPhone, the Apple App Store, or if you have an Android phone, the Google Play Store).
In addition, you can purchase the Paid Services, Clue Plus and other Clue Premium Features, from within the basic Clue App.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>4.5.
In order to help us continue to provide the Clue Services, we reserve the right to display advertisements on our website or in our app.
We may also offer the opportunity to donate via the website or app, so that you can support our services and mission.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.1.
Today, Clue exists only as an online service.</div> <p></p>

This requires an acceptance of these Terms and consent to data processing under the terms of our Privacy Policy, including all documents, declarations and consents included therein by reference.
Furthermore, you will need to provide a username, email address, and a personalized password.
In addition, you can provide other information as part of your onboarding, in order to personalize your Clue experience from the start.
Account creation is completed when you click on the link in the confirmation email sent to your email address, confirming your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.2.
Alternatively, you can create an account using your Apple, Google or Facebook login details, which automatically transfers your relevant personal information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.
When you create an account, you assure that all of the information you provide is correct and complete.
We recommend that you secure your data as permitted by your device (and detailed in the Privacy Policy, e.g.
PIN, Face ID or Touch ID).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.4.
We are not obliged to confirm or accept user registrations, and may, at our own discretion, refuse to create an account that may interfere with the Clue Services.
We may accept your registration or order by activating the relevant service, i.e.
without making a specific written declaration.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>ยง 6 Clue Plus and other Clue Premium Features (together, the "Paid Services")<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.1.
Within the free Clue App, we offer certain features and enhanced functionality as Paid Services.
These are referred to as <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Clue Plus<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> and other <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Premium Features<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
These services are generally tied to a subscription, i.e.
the regular purchase of the services over a fixed period of time for a specific fee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.2.
You can find an overview of the benefits included in a Clue Plus subscription on our website at https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/introducing-clue-plus.
These may change from time to time, as we introduce new features, develop our existing offering and sometimes retire features that aren't working out as planned.
The features and content contained in different Paid Services may differ by country and language.
The applicable price offer is shown in the relevant app store (Apple App Store or Google Play store) and on the buy screen in-app prior to purchase.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.3.
Like the Clue app itself, Clue Plus is only available via the third-party platform operators Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
Therefore, when you make a purchase within Clue, you additionally enter into a separate contract with the respective third-party service provider, whose terms and conditions apply.
The right of cancellation and revocation must be exercised as against these service providers (for more details about contract duration and termination see ยง 10)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.4.
The Paid Services are generally available on a subscription basis.
Therefore, you will be charged once in the duration period of your subscription (for instance per month or per year).
Our subscription will automatically be renewed at the same price at the end of the current subscription period, unless you have cancelled your subscription or disabled auto-renewals.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.5.
If payment cannot be collected, we will be entitled to block access to the relevant Paid Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>ยง 7 Your rights and duties as a user<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.1.
You may not transfer your user account to third parties.
You may only use Clue for your own private purposes or for such other purposes as we explicitly agree to in writing (for example, if you are an academic researcher and we enter into a research collaboration agreement).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.2.
Furthermore, you are not permitted to<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>make the access data sent or used for authentication and identification available to third parties or to pass them on to third parties;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>bypass the access control systems of paid services or to take other measures in order to use services without authorization;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>remove or obscure copyright notices and/or notices regarding trademarks or other intellectual property rights of Clue, companies affiliated with Clue or third parties;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>transfer or assign rights or obligations under these Terms to third parties.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.3.
When using the Clue App and services provided through the app, you must observe your contractual obligations with third parties, in particular your internet access provider and the relevant app store operator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.4.
For the best experience of the Clue Services, you must regularly update your operating systems and the version of the Clue App on your device.
It is also possible that certain activations may be required to make full use of the service.
From time to time, the Clue App may automatically download and install updates and upgrades without specifically informing you.
These updates are intended to technically improve and/or enhance the software and service.
You agree that we may implement such updates as part of your use of the Clue Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.5.
You are only entitled to a right of set-off insofar as you may have legally established a counterclaim against us, or we do not dispute such counterclaim.
A right of retention arises only if and insofar as the counterclaim is based on the same contractual relationship.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.3.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.4.
The commercial use or retransmission of the Clue Services is prohibited.
In particular, you may not copy or publish any part of the Clue App or website.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.5.
We use anonymous information from your usage of the Clue Services so that we can continue to improve them and for scientific research.
We process personal information for these purposes also, as set out in detail in our Privacy Policy, which you also consent to when you create a Clue account and use the Clue App.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>by creating an account and using Clue, you grant us permission to use your <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>anonymous<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> information to improve the Clue Services for all users and advance scientific research.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">In relation to the free Clue service, you may terminate the contractual relationship with us at any time by deleting your account in accordance with the instructions in the app.
If you are using Clue without an account, you can terminate this contract by deleting the Clue App from your mobile phone (remember to export your data first if you don't want to lose it).
</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="6124" data-revision="latest" data-offset="19077">We too may terminate the contract at our sole discretion and without further notice, subject to the following provisions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.2.
The Paid Services run for the agreed (initial) term.
At the end of the term, the contract is automatically extended by a time period equal to the agreed term, but by no more than one year, unless you or we terminate it before the end of the agreed term.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.3.
For technical and legal reasons, contractual relationships related to the use of Paid Services that were originally entered into via the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store can only be terminated via the respective app stores.
In such cases, Apple and Google act as resellers of the services.
The terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store apply.
According to Google and Apple, notice of termination must be provided no later than 24 hours before the renewal of the subscription.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.4.
The statutory right of both contracting parties to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected.
Good cause for extraordinary termination of the contract is deemed to exist if the continuation of the contractual relationship until the end of the normal period of notice is unreasonable, given all circumstances of the individual case and the interests of the user.
Good causes for us to exercise this right of termination include, in particular, if you breach applicable law, obligations under these Terms, or obligations under your contract with the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (or if your actions would cause us to breach our contracts with the Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
No prior notice of termination is required.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
