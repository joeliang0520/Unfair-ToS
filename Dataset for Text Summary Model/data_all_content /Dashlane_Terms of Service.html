<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Our “Terms of Service” are below.
You will have to accept them if you want to use our software, and we know that they are long and can be hard to follow.
We want you to understand what you are agreeing to, so each section starts with a short “plain English” summary.
The summaries are not part of the Terms, but are provided as an aid to understanding them.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>This is a legal contract between you and Dashlane.
You must be at least 18 years old to accept these Terms, which include our <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Privacy Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>.
We may change these Terms on occasion, and by continuing to use our Services after a change, you accept the revised Terms.
The Terms don’t apply to sites and services you may access through the Services that are operated by other companies.
Any subscription for paid Services will automatically renew unless you cancel it within thirty days of the renewal date.
If you are in the United States, any legal claim involving these Terms or the Services will be settled by arbitration, not by a trial in front of a judge or jury, or through a class action lawsuit.
These Terms are governed by New York State law.

Dashlane, Inc.
and its affiliates (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Dashlane<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”, or “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>we<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” and its derivatives) operate
www.dashlane.com (together with any subdomains, the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Site<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) and provide our users (each user, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>you<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) with mobile, desktop, and web applications (each an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>App<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” and, collectively, the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Apps<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
These Terms of Service (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) are a binding agreement between you and Dashlane SAS (if you are a French resident) or Dashlane USA, Inc.
(for everyone else) regarding your use of the Site, the Apps, and any related services we may perform (the Site, Apps and services together, the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
As used in these Terms, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>device<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” means any computer, phone, tablet, or other computer hardware on which Apps run.

These Terms do not apply to third-party websites, services and applications (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Third-Party Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) you may access through the Services.
Unless required by applicable law, we are not responsible for the content or practices of Third-Party Services and provide links to them only for your convenience.

Your use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Supplemental Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
If any provision of the Supplemental Terms conflicts with these Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to such Service.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>f.
Dashlane Business is our offering for businesses.
If you are purchasing a Dashlane Business license, you will be bound by
Dashlane Business Terms, and not these Terms, with respect to your use of the Services.
Individual users accessing Dashlane under a Dashlane Business license are still required to accept these Terms, since Dashlane Business users also receive access to a “Personal” space that is not available to the Business account administrator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>g.
THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE IF THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.
By accepting these Terms, you are waiving certain rights to legal remedies you may otherwise have.
Arbitration is not permitted in certain jurisdictions.
Please see Sections 10 and 12 for more information.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>h.
Any dispute or claim arising under these Terms or related to the Services will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of New York, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions that would require a different result.
The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>i.
We may change these Terms at any time.
When we do so, we will post the updated Terms on this page and also inform you through the Services, as applicable.
Any changes to the Terms will be effective immediately for new users and thirty (30) days after we post notice of the changes on the Site or inform users of the changes via the Services for existing users.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>To use our Apps, you must create an account.
Account Information must always be accurate.
You must also create a Master Password, which is used to generate the encryption keys that protect the information you store on the Services.
DASHLANE DOES NOT STORE OR HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR MASTER PASSWORD, AND IF THE MASTER PASSWORD IS LOST, DASHLANE CANNOT UNLOCK YOUR ACCOUNT OR RETRIEVE ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Accounts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
To use the Services, you must download an App, or access a pre-installed App on your device, and create an account (an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Account<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) by providing your email address (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Account Email<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) and a master password (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Master Password<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” and, together with the Account Email, the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Credentials<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>").
Keep your Credentials secure and do not share them with anyone.
You are responsible for all activities on the Services associated with your Account.
You represent that any information you provide to us in connection with your Account (e.g., billing information when you pay for a Subscription) will be accurate, and that you will keep it updated for so long as you have an Account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Master Password.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>Your Master Password is critical to the security of your Account.
It is used to generate the encryption keys used to protect Secured Data (as defined in Section 4(c)) and to transfer Secured Data among your authorized devices.
DASHLANE DOES NOT STORE, HAVE ACCESS TO, OR HAVE ANY MEANS OF RECREATING OR RETREIVING YOUR MASTER PASSWORD OR ACCESSING SECURED DATA IF YOU LOSE YOUR MASTER PASSWORD.
This is an essential security feature intended to protect your Secured Data should our systems be compromised.
We are not responsible for any inability to access your Account or Secured Data caused by loss of your Master Password.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>You have a limited license to use our Apps for your personal or (if applicable) internal business use, along with any documentation and updates applicable to the Apps and Services you use.
You may not (try to) hack, reverse-engineer, break the law using, or otherwise do “bad” things with or to the Services.
We are not required to support the Apps (but we do and will continue to do so).
Your use of mobile Apps is subject to additional terms imposed by the “App Store” from which you downloaded the App.
Keeping our Apps compatible with the rest of the digital world takes a lot of work, and sometimes Apps may not work with a particular site or service, even if they did before.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>License<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Dashlane grants you a personal, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license to download and install the Apps in object code format, on one or more devices, solely for your own personal or internal business purposes.
The license includes the right to (i) access, use, and make a reasonable number of copies of any published descriptions of the functionality, technical requirements, or use of the Services (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Documentation<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), and (ii) use any changes to the Apps made available to all users of such Apps at no additional cost (each an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Update<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) when each Update is made generally available.
Updates may be installed automatically or may require installation by you.
Failure to install an Update may result in an App or the Services not functioning correctly.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Support<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
The license granted in Section 3(a) does not entitle you to receive any support for the Apps or Services, though we may choose to (and do) provide it.
While Dashlane strives to constantly improve the Services, we are not required to fix any specific error, bug, or issue except as set forth in Section 9(a).
We generally support only the current version of the platform or operating system on which the Services run (e.g., iOS, Windows).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>d.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>App Store Restrictions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> i.
The availability of mobile Apps is dependent on the entity from whom you obtained the App (each an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>App Store<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
The relevant App Store is not a party to these Terms, and Dashlane, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Services and any related claims (e.g., legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).
You are responsible for connectivity fees associated with your use of any Apps or App Store and any fees charged by an App Store in connection with the Services.
You will comply with all applicable App Store terms and policies when using any mobile App.
The App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce them.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> ii.
You will only use Apps accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (A) on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system), and (B) as permitted by the “Usage Rules” in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>e.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Third-Party Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
The Apps are designed to work with many Third-Party Services, however, their continued compatibility with any specific application, site, or service is dependent on such Third-Party Service.
To maintain compatibility with particular applications, you may need to update an App or a third party application from time to time.
We cannot guarantee that any currently supported Third-Party Services will remain compatible with the Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;blockquote&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Summary: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>We provide the Services, but you are responsible for how you use them—both in making sure the data you store in the Apps is correct and for how it is used (including when you use the Services to share data with others).
Like most providers of consumer applications, while we make every effort to ensure that our features work correctly, we cannot and do not guarantee that they will always do so.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Services offer features that save you time and protect your data.
In-depth information about features and availability can be found at
www.dashlane.com/plans.
We may remove features from the Services or certain Apps at any time, and not all features are available with all plans and in all jurisdictions.
And while we strive to ensure the proper operation of the Services, <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>we explicitly do not guarantee that they will work properly at all times, be error-free, or be available on an uninterrupted basis.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> How you use the Services is up to you, and you acknowledge the following: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Secured Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
The Services can be used to store many kinds of data, including contact information, credit card information, IDs (such as a driver’s license or passport), and important notes (collectively “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Secured Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
While we use strong encryption and other security measures to protect Secured Data, we do not guarantee that Secured Data is or will be 100% protected.
Dashlane does not and cannot screen Secured Data.
You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the Secured Data and how you use it.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Passwords<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
While the passwords created by the Services are designed to be as secure as possible, we cannot guarantee their security, and we explicitly do not claim that they are immune to attack.
Nor do we guarantee that the password generator or autofill functions will work properly with all Third-Party Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Payments<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
If you use Dashlane to store and enter credit card and other payment information, (each a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment Method<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), you are solely responsible for complying with the terms and conditions governing each Payment Method.
We are not a party to, or responsible for, any transaction facilitated with the Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>d.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Sharing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
If you use the sharing features of the Services, you (i) authorize us to share the data you select with the individual(s) you choose, and you warrant that you have the right to do so (e.g., you may not share a password that is for your personal use only).
You are solely responsible for granting and revoking sharing privileges and the consequences of all actions recipients take with your shared data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>e.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Syncing.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>If you have a multi-device account with syncing enabled, updates to Secured Data made on one device may not be available on another device if (i) that device is unable to access the internet or Dashlane servers.
(ii) the App is improperly configured, or you have not installed the most recent verio of the App.
(iii) you uninstall the App from that device, or (iv) you forget your Master Password.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>f.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Emergency Contacts<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
An emergency contact is an individual you designate to receive your Secured Data if you die or are incapacitated.
You must define the specific conditions under which the contact wlll receive your Secured Data when setting up this feature.
You grant Dashlane permission to send Secured Data to the emergency contact if those conditions are met, and you release Dashlane from any liability arising from such a release.
You must keep emergency contact information up to date.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>g.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Dark Web Monitoring<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Through a third-party partner, the Services can scan the “dark web” to see whether information associated with your Secured Data may have been compromised (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Dark Web Monitoring<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Dark Web Monitoring is tied to your email address(es), which must be verified to activate this feature.
Dashlane provides Dark Web Monitoring on an “as-is” basis and does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the results.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>h.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>VPN (not available in all jurisdictions)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Through a third-party partner, the Services let you connect to a virtual private network (VPN) to browse the internet more securely when using public and unsecured wifi networks.
Dashlane is not responsible for the availability, performance, or reliability of the VPN and does not guarantee that the VPN is totally secure.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>i.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Credit Monitoring and Restoration<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Create an account with and access Transunion’s CreditView Dashboard through the Apps.
Use of this feature is governed by Transunion’s terms, and Dashlane is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of the information available on it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>j.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Identity Theft Insurance<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Identity theft insurance available through the Services is underwritten by subsidiaries or affiliates of American International Group, Inc.
and subject to the limitations, exclusions, and other provisions of the policy, copies of which are available on our Site or upon request to our
help center.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Where you sign up for paid access to the Services (a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) through the Site, you must provide credit card or PayPal account information.
All Subscription Fees are due in advance, and Subscriptions will automatically renew (and you will be charged) annually unless you cancel your Account.
Subscription Fees will be refunded only if you cancel your Subscription within thirty (30) days of when payment is due.
We will inform you prior to your Subscription renewing.
We charge sales tax where required.
By submitting payment, you consent to the terms of use and privacy policy of the relevant payment processor (e.g., Stripe)..
Payment practices of App Stores may differ according to their terms.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Certain features of the Services are only available with a paid access plan (a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Subscription levels, features, and pricing are available at
www.dashlane.com/plans.
Fees for Subscriptions (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription Fees<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) are due in advance for each billing period, with the initial payment due when you add a Subscription to your Account (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription Start Date<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Except as expressly stated in these Terms, Subscription Fees are non-refundable and are based on our standard charges and billing terms in effect when payment is due.
You must provide us with a valid credit card or other payment method we accept (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment Provider<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) prior to starting a Subscription and promptly update your Account if there is any change to your payment information.
Your Payment Provider agreement, not these Terms, governs your use of your designated Payment Provider.
We may change our fees and billing practices at any time, either by posting notice of such change on the Site or notifying you within the Services, provided that any such change will not apply to you until the next Subscription period or if you change your Subscription type.
If you upgrade your Subscription, you will pay for a full year of the new Subscription level but receive a pro-rata credit for the remaining value of your prior Subscription.

We will inform you via email thirty (30) days before your Subscription date.
By subscribing, you authorize us to charge your Payment Provider at the beginning of any Subscription period if you have not cancelled your Account by such time.
If we cannot process payment from your Payment Provider, we will reach out to you to update your Payment Provider information or make other arrangements for payment.
If we do not receive payment within fifteen (15) days of the renewal, we may terminate your Subscription.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.

You will be able to use any Subscription you cancel until its scheduled expiration, but you will not be eligible for any pro-rata refund of the current term.
However, we will refund the full Subscription Fee if you request a refund within thirty (30) days of the Subscription Start Date or any Subscription renewal date.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Taxes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Any sales, use, value added, or other tax based on the Subscription that we are required to pass through to customers is automatically calculated and added to all orders where applicable (except for users in the European Economic Area, (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>EEA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) where VAT is included in the amount charged to you by Dashlane).
To the extent applicable, all payments for the Services will be made free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes.
Sales tax is the sole responsibility of the user.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>e.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Payment Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
We use Stripe, Paypal and Checkout.com (each, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment Processor<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services).
By paying for a Subscription, you agree to be bound by the applicable Payment Processor’s terms and policies, and authorize us and the Payment Processor to share any information and payment instructions you provide with your Payment Provider and any other Third-Party Service provider(s) solely as required to complete your transactions.

If we cannot charge your Payment Provider, if you materially breach these Terms, or if required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Services becomes unlawful), we may (but are not required to) suspend or terminate your Subscription and/or Account, with or without notice.
Termination under this Section 8(b) is at Dashlane’s sole discretion, and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such termination.

When a Subscription expires or is terminated by Dashlane pursuant to Section 8(b), you will no longer have access to the Service features associated with the Subscription.

If you close your Account, all licenses granted in these Terms will immediately terminate and you must stop all use of the Apps.
We may delete all data associated with your Account from our servers, including Secured Data and Credentials, without liability or obligation to you.
Note that, even if you close your Account, you must delete our Apps to remove Secured Data from your devices.
Even if you do not delete the Apps, you will not be able to access Secured Data after you close your Account (though such access may continue for a short period depending on your Master Password settings within the App).
