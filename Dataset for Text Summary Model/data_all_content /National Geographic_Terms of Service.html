or an “Attendee,” meaning that you have registered to use the Educational Opportunities and that you intend to audit the Educational Opportunities (i.e., attend or view lectures online without completing homework assignments, exams or other course work).
The term “Course User” refers to a Visitor, Student or Attendee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
