<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Customer Terms of Service (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Customer Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) describe your rights and responsibilities when using our online workplace productivity tools and platform (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Please read them carefully.
If you are a Customer (defined below), these Customer Terms govern your access and use of our Services.
If you are being invited to a workspace set up by a Customer, the User Terms of Service (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>User Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) govern your access and use of the Services.
We are grateful you’re here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>First Things FirstThese “Customer Terms” Form a Part of a Binding “Contract”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Customer Terms (or, if applicable, your written agreement with us) and any Order Form(s) (defined below) together form a binding “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Contract<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>” between Customer and us.
If any terms in the Customer-Specific Supplement apply to Customer (e.g., if Customer is a U.S.
government entity), those terms are also incorporated herein by reference and form part of the Contract.
“We,” “our” and “us” refers to the applicable Slack entity in the section entitled “Which Slack Entity is Customer Contracting With?” below.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Your Agreement On Behalf of “Customer”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you purchase subscription(s), create a workspace (i.e., a digital space where a group of users may access the Services, as further described in our Help Center pages), invite users to that workspace, or use or allow use of that workspace after being notified of a change to these Customer Terms, you acknowledge your understanding of the then-current Contract and agree to the Contract on behalf of Customer.
Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Customer Choices and InstructionsWho is “Customer”? (Hint: There can be only one)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“Customer” is the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Contract.
If your workspace is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with an organization, Customer is the individual creating the workspace.
For example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but haven't formed a company yet, you are the Customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Signing Up Using a Corporate Email Domain<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you signed up for a plan using your corporate email domain, your organization is Customer, and Customer can modify and re-assign roles on your workspace (including your role) and otherwise exercise its rights under the Contract.
If Customer elects to replace you as the representative with ultimate authority for the workspace, we will provide you with notice following such election and you agree to take any actions reasonably requested by us or Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of Customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>What This Means for Customer—and for Us<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Individuals authorized by Customer to access the Services (an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Authorized User<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) may submit content or information to the Services, such as messages or files (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Customer Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), and Customer may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with it.
For example, Customer may provision or deprovision access to the Services, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign workspaces, share channels, or consolidate workspaces or channels with other workspaces or channels.
Since these choices and instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, modification or deletion of certain or all Customer Data, please review the Help Center pages for more information about these choices and instructions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Customer will (a) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Data.
and (b) ensure the transfer and processing of Customer Data under the Contract is lawful.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Ordering Subscriptions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>A subscription allows an Authorized User to access the Services.
No matter the role, a subscription is required for each Authorized User.
A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between Customer and us (each, an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Order Form<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Please see the Help Center for more information on procuring subscriptions and inviting new Authorized Users.
Each Authorized User must agree to the User Terms to activate their subscription.
Subscriptions commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Services “check-out” interface or in the Order Form, as applicable.
Each subscription is for a single Authorized User for a specified term and is personal to that Authorized User.
We sometimes enter into other kinds of ordering arrangements, but that would need to be spelled out and agreed to in an Order Form.
During an active subscription term, adding more subscriptions is fairly easy.
Unless the Order Form says otherwise, Customer may purchase more subscriptions at the same price stated in the Order Form and all will terminate on the same date.
Check out our Help Center pages for additional information on setting up a workspace and assigning roles.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Purchasing Decisions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may share information about our future product plans because we like transparency.
Our public statements about those product plans are an expression of intent, but do not rely on them when making a purchase.
If Customer decides to buy our Services, that decision should be based on the functionality or features we have made available today and not on the delivery of any future functionality or features.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Choosing to be a Beta Tester<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Occasionally, we look for beta testers to help us test our new features.
These features will be identified as “beta” or “pre-release,” or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Beta Product<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Beta Products may not be ready for prime time so they are made available “as is,” and any warranties or contractual commitments we make for other Services do not apply.
Should Customer encounter any faults with our Beta Products, we would love to hear about them.
our primary reason for running any beta programs is to iron out issues before making a new feature widely available.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Feedback is Welcome<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The more suggestions our customers make, the better the Services become.
If Customer sends us any feedback or suggestions regarding the Services, there is a chance we will use it, so Customer grants us (for itself and all of its Authorized Users and other Customer personnel) an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation or compensation to Customer, any Authorized User or other Customer personnel.
If we choose not to implement the suggestion, please don’t take it personally.
We appreciate it nonetheless.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Non-Slack Products<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Our Services include a platform that third parties may use to develop applications and software that complement Customer’s use of the Services (each, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Non-Slack Product<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
We also maintain a directory called the Slack App Directory where some Non-Slack Products are available for installation.
THESE ARE NOT OUR SERVICES, SO WE DO NOT WARRANT OR SUPPORT NON-SLACK PRODUCTS, AND, ULTIMATELY, CUSTOMER (AND NOT US) WILL DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO ENABLE THEM.
ANY USE OF A NON-SLACK PRODUCT IS SOLELY BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If a Non-Slack Product is enabled for Customer’s workspace, please be mindful of any Customer Data that will be shared with the third party provider and the purposes for which the provider requires access.
We will not be responsible for any use, disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data that is transmitted to, or accessed by, a Non-Slack Product.
Check out our Help Center pages for more information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Privacy Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how we collect and use data relating to the use and performance of our websites and products.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Customer and Authorized UsersUse of the Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Customer must comply with the Contract and ensure that its Authorized Users comply with the Contract and the User Terms.
We may review conduct for compliance purposes, but we have no obligation to do so.
We aren't responsible for the content of any Customer Data or the way Customer or its Authorized Users choose to use the Services to store or process any Customer Data.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 16.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>

Customer must ensure that all Authorized Users are over 16 years old.
Customer is solely responsible for providing high speed internet service for itself and its Authorized Users to access and use the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Our Removal Rights<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we believe that there is a violation of the Contract that can simply be remedied by Customer’s removal of certain Customer Data or Customer’s disabling of a Non-Slack Product, we will, in most cases, ask Customer to take direct action rather than intervene.
However, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action, if Customer does not take appropriate action, or if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Authorized Users, or any third parties.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Payment ObligationsPayment Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>For Customers that purchase our Services, fees are specified at the Services interface “check-out” and in the Order Form(s) — and must be paid in advance.

For clarity, in the event Customer downgrades any subscriptions from a paid plan to a free plan, Customer will remain responsible for any unpaid fees under the paid plan, and Services under the paid plan will be deemed fully performed and delivered upon expiration of the initial paid plan subscription term.
Check out our Help Center pages for more information about payment options.
If we agree to invoice Customer by email, full payment must be received within thirty (30) days from the invoice date.
Fees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Taxes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Customer will be responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases, except for those taxes based on our net income.
Should any payment for the Services be subject to withholding tax by any government, Customer will reimburse us for such withholding tax.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Fair Billing Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We believe customers should only pay for subscriptions that are actually used, so we offer a Fair Billing Policy.
Certain exceptions and conditions may apply, as noted in the Services interface “check-out” or in an Order Form.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Credits<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any credits that may accrue to Customer’s account (for example, from a promotion or application of the Fair Billing Policy), will expire following expiration or termination of the applicable Contract, will have no currency or exchange value, and will not be transferable or refundable.
Credits accrued to a workspace on a free subscription plan will expire if the workspace’s plan is not upgraded to a paid plan within ninety (90) days of accrual, unless otherwise specified.
For more information on credits, please see the Help Center.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Downgrade for Non-Payment<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If any fees owed to us by Customer (excluding amounts disputed reasonably and in good faith) are thirty (30) days or more overdue, we may, without limiting our other rights and remedies, downgrade any fee-based Services to free plans until those amounts are paid in full, so long as we have given Customer ten (10) or more days’ prior notice that its account is overdue.
Notwithstanding the second paragraph of the “Providing the Services” section below, Customer acknowledges and agrees that a downgrade will result in a decrease in certain features and functionality and potential loss of access to Customer Data, as illustrated by comparing the plans in the Pricing Guide.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

In those cases, the credits will serve as what the lawyers call liquidated damages and will be Customer’s sole remedy for the downtime and related inconvenience.
For all Service plans, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, excluding planned downtime.
