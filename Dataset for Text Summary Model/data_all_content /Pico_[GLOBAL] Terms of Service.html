PURCHASE OF DIGITAL PRODUCTS<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By making any order through Pico to purchase (even if the price is indicated as zero) or download any Digital Product, and completing a transaction, you are agreeing to these Terms and any third-party terms associated with use of the particular Digital Product.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can place an order with respect to the Digital Products of your choice.
When placing an order, you may be required to provide certain information (including your contact and shipping information).
You represent and warrant that all such provided information is accurate, complete, and will be kept current.
We shall have no obligation to verify the information you provide, and we shall not be responsible or liable for inaccurate or incomplete information.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Each Digital Product listing may indicate the particular manner in which you may be required to use the Digital Product, as well as any terms in relation thereto.
It is your responsibility to review such information carefully before placing an order to purchase the Digital Product.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your purchase of a Digital Product is a payment for a limited, non-assignable license to access and use the content or functionality in the Digital Product.
Certain digital content (e.g.
virtual characters or character names, etc) purchased or available to you may only be used in connection with the Digital Product where you obtained them or where they were developed by you as a result of gameplay or other in-app activity.
Such digital content is not redeemable or subject to refund and cannot be traded outside of the Digital Product for money or other items of value.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Except as expressly stated in these Terms or other policies as may be notified to you from time to time via our approved channels, all purchases from Pico Store are final and non-refundable.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you delete your account, you may lose access to and use of any purchased Digital Product.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

PRICES AND PAYMENT<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The price applicable to your transaction will be the price that was in effect at the time of the transaction.
If your order is accepted and processed where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognized by you as a mispricing, we may cancel your order, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any&amp;nbsp;Digital Products provided to you on such terms as may be notified to you.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that any payment made on or through Pico Store shall be made using any of the payment methods prescribed by us from time to time, and all charges and/or fees are to be paid in accordance with specific instructions as may be prescribed by us.
You are solely responsible for all amounts payable associated with purchases you make on Pico Store.
Your access to and/or use of the payment methods provided on Pico Store shall be entirely at your own risk.
We may from time to time, add, remove, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any payment processing method in our sole and absolute discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must abide by any relevant terms and conditions or other agreement that governs your access and/or use of any payment or related functionalities (including without limitation payment methods) in connection with the acceptance and processing of payments (including in respect of payment gateway services, settlement, and refunds) ("Payment Features") made available via Pico Store, which may be provided by Third Party Providers (as defined below), including financial services providers providing or facilitating the provision of Payment Features, e.g.
banks, payment services businesses, payment networks, financial institutions and other financial intermediaries (each a "Financial Services Provider").
You acknowledge and agree that: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>by providing your credit card, debit card or other payment method details, you authorize the Financial Services Provider to charge your credit card, debit card or other payment method account, upon your confirmation of your purchase, the amount of your purchase, including all fees and taxes thereon.
You hereby grant Pico and the relevant Financial Services Provider your consent to them respectively collecting, using and disclosing your payment details for processing your order;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the fullest extent of our obligations in connection with any such Payment Features is only to facilitate the making available of such Payment Features by Financial Services Providers to you on a "pass-through" basis and "as received" by us.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you must render reasonable cooperation and assistance to us to enable us to comply with any terms and conditions imposed from time to time on us by such Financial Services Provider in connection with Payment Features.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If any payments made by you to us under these Terms that are subject to any withholding taxes levied by any governmental and taxation authorities, you shall be responsible for such withholding taxes.
In this event, all amounts payable by you under these Terms must be paid free and clear of, and without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding for, any taxes, currency control restrictions or other withholdings.
If required by applicable laws to set-off, counterclaim, deduct or withhold, you will gross up the relevant amount to ensure that we receive the full cash amount that it would have received without such deduction or withholding.

We may also from time to time make available functionalities that enable users of our Services to extract all or any portion of User Content created by another user to produce additional User Content, including collaborative User Content with other users, that combine and intersperse User Content generated by more than one user, or enable users to overlay music, graphics, stickers, virtual items, and other elements provided by Pico ("Pico Elements") onto User Content and transmit this User Content through our Services.
The information and materials in the User Content, including User Content that includes Pico Elements, have not been verified or approved by us.
The views expressed by other users on our Services do not represent our views or values.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
