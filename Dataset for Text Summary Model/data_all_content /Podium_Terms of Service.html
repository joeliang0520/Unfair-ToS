<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Availability.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Subject to the terms of this Agreement and any scheduled maintenance and unavailability caused by: (a) actions or omissions of Client.
(b) failures, errors or defects in the facilities, hardware, software or network of Client.
or (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium’s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term.
Client’s sole remedy and Podium’s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability shall be support in accordance with Section 6.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 6.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Support.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Podium makes available web-based support through the Website.
Additional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation.
Any support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium’s applicable support policies.
Podium may also provide onboarding, deployment and other services under this Agreement.
The scope, pricing and other terms for these additional services will be set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation.
Podium’s ability to deliver the Services will depend on Client’s reasonable and timely cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>FEES AND PAYMENT.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 7.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Fees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>").
Client agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subscription Fees<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (collectively, the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Fees<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>").
Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement.
Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 7.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Payment of Fees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S.
dollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S.
dollars.
Subscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause).
If the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term.
For the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-review basis on Client’s existing Subscription Start Date.
The Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8.
You must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account.
If Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due.
Should Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue.
Podium shall have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less.
Additionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium shall have the right to immediately suspend Client’s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client’s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 7.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Taxes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Podium’s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium.
Client will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium’s invoices.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 7.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annual Fee Increase.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>TERM AND TERMINATION.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 8.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Term.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein.
Unless otherwise stated in Client’s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subscription Term<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>"), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Term.
Client may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com.
If no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subscription Start Date<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>").
By agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term.
Client cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 8.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Suspension of Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
Podium may suspend Client’s access to the Services if: (a) Client’s account is overdue or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits.
Podium may also suspend Client’s access to the Services, remove Client Data or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights.
Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations).
or (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other Clients or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services.
Podium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above.
For avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period.
Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 8.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Termination for Cause<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach.
(b) ceases operation without a successor.
or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
If Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term.
Podium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights.
Restrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties’ BAA.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 8.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Effect of Termination<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client’s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium’s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes and any other Podium Confidential Information in Client’s possession, custody or control and (b) Client’s right to access any Client Data in the applicable Services will cease, and unless otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time.
If Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client.
Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 8.5.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 9.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Obligation of Confidentiality.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, each party (as the receiving party) must: (a) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties.
and (b) use the other party’s Confidential Information only as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement.
Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Podium, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 16.4), provided that such party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 9 and these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 9.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Exclusions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party.
(b) was known by the receiving party prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.
(c) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.
or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information.
A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advance notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 9.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Remedies<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
The parties acknowledge that disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so upon breach of this Section each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 10.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Ownership and Updates.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> By accepting this Agreement, Client acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Services and irrespective of any use of the words "purchase", "sale" or similar terms, no ownership rights are transferred to Client under this Agreement and, except as expressly permitted by such limited right, Client may not make any use of Podium Technology.
Client agrees that Podium (or its suppliers) exclusively retains all rights, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Services, products, any and all related documentation, software, technology, code, know-how, logos, trademarks, service marks, and templates (including in any reports or output obtained from the Services), anything delivered as part of support, materials or other services, and any updates, modifications or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback (as defined below) ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Podium Technology<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") provided by Podium (which is deemed Podium’s Confidential Information) and reserves any licenses not specifically granted herein.
Furthermore, Podium exclusively owns and reserves all right, title, and interest in and to Podium’s Confidential Information and any data, in anonymized or aggregated form that does not identify you, any end users, or any natural person, generated or derived from the use or operation of the Services, including volumes, frequencies, bounce rates, and performance results for the Services.
The Services are offered as an on-line, hosted product.
Accordingly, Client acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Services and that Podium at its option may make updates, bug fixes, modifications or improvements to the Services from time-to-time.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 10.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Feedback.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> If Client elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas or other feedback or related materials to Podium (collectively, "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Feedback<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>"), Client hereby grants Podium a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any such Feedback in any manner without any obligation, payment or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.
Nothing in this Agreement limits Podium’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AND INTEGRATIONS<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Podium may make arrangements with third-party providers, or facilitate Client making arrangements with third-party providers, that provide products or services in connection with the Services described in this Agreement.
If Client elects to use applications, integrations, add-ons, software, code, online services, systems and other products not developed by Podium ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Third-Party Products<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") in connection with or otherwise made available through the Services, those products may make Third-Party Content available to Client and may access Client’s instance of the Services, including Client Data.
Client agrees and acknowledges that use of such Third-Party Products may require Client to enter into separate terms and conditions with such third-party.
Podium is not a party to any such terms and will not be liable thereunder.
Podium does not warrant or support Third-Party Products or Third-Party Content (whether or not these items are designated by Podium as "powered", "verified" or otherwise) and disclaims all responsibility and liability for these items and their access to the Services, including their modification, deletion, disclosure or collection of Client Data.
Podium is not responsible in any way for Client Data once it is transmitted, copied or removed from the Services.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>12.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>INDEMNIFICATION<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 12.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Indemnification by Client.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Client will indemnify and hold harmless Podium and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (together, the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Podium Entities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to: (a) your unauthorized use of, or misuse of, the Services.
(b) your violation of any applicable law or third party right, including any intellectual property right or publicity, confidentiality, other property, or privacy right.

(d) any demand, dispute or issue (including without limitation fee disputes) between you and your Payment Processor (as defined in the applicable Additional Terms).
(e) any Client Data.
(f) Podium’s use, as contemplated in this Agreement, of any information provided to Podium by you or your Customers.
(g) breach or alleged breach of this Agreement, including Client’s Warranties and Obligations.
(h) any claim of a governmental entity or other party that you have violated any law, rule, or regulation.
or, (i) if applicable, alleged breach or breach of Client’s obligations contained in the BAA.
Client also agrees to defend the Podium Entities against these claims at Podium’s request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.
In the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims.
Client must not settle any claim without Podium’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts or take or refrain from taking any action.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 12.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Indemnification by Podium.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Podium will indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any third-party claims and related costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising from or pertaining to (i) Podium’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
or (ii) Podium’s infringement, misappropriation or violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights.
Podium also agrees to defend Client against these claims at Client’s request, but Client may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the Parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.
Podium must not settle any claim without Client’s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Client from liability or would require Client to admit fault, pay any amounts or take or refrain from taking any action.

NEITHER PODIUM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

PODIUM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY CLIENT PROPERTIES, THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, OR NON-PODIUM SERVICES (INCLUDING FOR ANY DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, TRANSMISSION ERRORS, SECURITY FAILURES, AND OTHER PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THESE ITEMS), FOR THE COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF CLIENT DATA AUTHORIZED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR DECISIONS OR ACTIONS TAKEN (OR NOT TAKEN) BY CLIENT BASED UPON PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR PODIUM’S RELATED SERVICES (INCLUDING CHANGES TO CLIENT PROPERTIES).
THE DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN.
CLIENT MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS.
HOWEVER, ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> 13.2.
NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICES OR PODIUM ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE PODIUM ENTITIES OR THE SERVICES THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.
PODIUM DOES NOT PROVIDE ITS CLIENTS WITH LEGAL ADVICE REGARDING DATA PRIVACY OR COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT LAW IN ANY JURISDICTION, AND ANY STATEMENTS MADE BY PODIUM TO ITS CLIENT(S) DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE.
USE OF THE SERVICES DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS IN ANY JURISDICTION.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>14.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST OR INACCURATE DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, COSTS OF DELAY, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, COVER, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, HOWEVER CAUSED, EVEN IF INFORMED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
IN NO EVENT WILL PODIUM’S OR ITS SUPPLIERS’ TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PODIUM FOR THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S) OR RELATED SERVICE(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
FOR FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS OR BETA RELEASES PROVIDED WITHOUT CHARGE, PODIUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE FIFTY U.S.
DOLLARS ($50.00 US).
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NONE OF THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 EXCLUDES EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR FRAUD OR FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY A PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE.
IN ADDITION, THE LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION.
IF ANY OF THESE LAWS IS FOUND TO APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH LAW.
EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THIS SECTION 14 IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN AND A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY PODIUM TECHNOLOGY OR ANY RELATED SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.
THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS.
THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 14 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

Waivers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span> Podium may update or modify these Terms (including the Additional Terms and any referenced policies and other documents) from time to time by posting a revised version on the Website or Services or by notification via the email associated with your account.
If a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you may be required to click through the updated Terms to show acceptance and to continue to use the Services.
Material modifications are effective upon the earlier of your acceptance of the modified Terms or upon your next subsequent Subscription Term.

No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

Waivers must be made in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.
