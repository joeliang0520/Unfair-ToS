Description of the Platform
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Platform is a hosting service.
Registered users of the Platform may submit, upload and post audio, text, photos, pictures, graphics, comments, and other content, data or information (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Content"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>), which will be stored by SoundCloud at the direction of such registered users, and may be shared and distributed by such registered users, and other users of the Platform, using the tools and features provided as part of the Platform and accessible via the Website, Apps and elsewhere.
The Platform also enables registered users to interact with one another and to contribute to discussions, and enables any user of the Website, Apps or certain Services (who may or may not be registered users of the Platform) to view, listen to and share Content uploaded and made available by registered users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Platform also includes social and interactive features that enable users to engage with and learn from the SoundCloud community in order to build a following and ensure you get the content that interests you most.
For example, users who upload content to SoundCloud will gain access to our creator stats feature, which provides creators with insights into how the content they upload fares among users, including which users are top listeners and downloaders of such content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some features of our Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a certain Service (see Subscriptions and Gift Codes below).
SoundCloud however remains free for users that choose not to subscribe to such Services.
In order to make the Platform available for free and provide you with personally relevant features, we serve tailored ads on the Platform on behalf of third party advertisers.
To that end, we use information that you make available to us when you interact with the Platform to inform the nature of the ads we show you and provide you with a customized experience.
More information on how we use data to show you personalized ads is described in our Privacy Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may, from time to time, release new tools and resources on the Website, release new versions of our Apps, or introduce other services and/or features for the Platform.
Any new services and features will be subject to these Terms of Use as well as any additional terms and conditions that we may release for those specific services or features.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Your SoundCloud account
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You are not obliged to register to use the Platform.
However, access to the Apps and certain Services is only available to registered users.
As an example, our App, SoundCloud Pulse, enables registered users, who upload and make available their Content to other users, to receive instant feedback on the performance of their tracks, communicate with their listeners, and manage their Content anytime.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order for you to engage with other SoundCloud listeners and creators, we enable you to create and personalize a public profile on SoundCloud.
To enable you to do that, you must provide us with the information you want to display on such profile.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order to help you to navigate and discover content on the Platform that interests you, as a registered user you will also receive auto-generated personalized recommendations of other content that might appeal to you, based on your listening habits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you register to use the Platform, you will provide us with your email address, and will choose a username and password for your account.
You must ensure that the email address that you provide is, and remains, valid.
Your email address and any other information you chose to provide about yourself will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

To the extent it is necessary in order for SoundCloud to provide you with any of the aforementioned hosting services, to undertake any of the tasks set forth in these Terms of Use, including the distribution of advertising or other promotional material on our Platform and/or to enable your use of the Platform, you hereby grant such licenses to SoundCloud on a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully paid basis.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Data protection, privacy and cookies
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>All personal data that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Platform is collected, stored, used, disclosed and otherwise processed by SoundCloud in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In addition, in common with most online services, we use cookies to help us understand how people are using the Platform, so that we can continue to improve the service we offer.
Our use of cookies, and how to disable cookies, is explained in our Cookies Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Meetups
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>SoundCloud has an active community of users, many of whom organize and attend face-to-face meetings at venues all over the world (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Meetups"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>).
While SoundCloud is generally supportive of Meetups and may provide branded promotional materials to help organizers promote their Meetups, SoundCloud does not sponsor, oversee or in any way control such Meetups.
You hereby acknowledge and agree that your attendance and participation in any Meetups is entirely at your own risk and SoundCloud does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions of any SoundCloud users or any third parties who organize, attend or are otherwise involved in any Meetups.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Competitions and other promotions
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>From time to time, some SoundCloud® users may promote competitions, promotions, prize draws and other similar opportunities on the Platform (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Third Party Competitions"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>).
SoundCloud is not the sponsor or promoter of these Third Party Competitions, and does not bear any responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any third parties who organize, administer or are otherwise involved in any promotion of these Third Party Competitions.
If you wish to participate in any of these Third Party Competitions, it is your responsibility to read the terms and conditions applicable to the relevant Third Party Competition and to ensure that you understand the rules and any eligibility requirements, and are lawfully able to participate in such Third Party Competitions in your country of residence.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you wish to run your own Third Party Competition on the Platform, you are free to do so provided you comply with our Competition Terms, which are available here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Use of SoundCloud players and widget
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Platform includes access to customizable players (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Players"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>), and an embeddable version of the SoundCloud waveform player (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Widget"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) for incorporation into users’ own sites, third party sites or social media profiles, whether or not a Linked Service.
This functionality is provided to enable Uploaders to put their Content wherever they wish, and to enable other users of the Platform to share and distribute Content within the parameters set by the Uploader.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget in such a way that you aggregate Content from the Platform into a separate destination that replicates substantially the offering of the Website, or comprises a content service of which Content from the Platform forms a material part.
Similarly, you may not, without the prior written consent of SoundCloud, use the Players or the Widget to embed Content into any website or other destination dedicated to a particular artist (except where the relevant Content is Your Content and you are the person or are authorized to represent the person to whom the site or destination is dedicated), or to a particular genre.
You may not use the Players or Widget in any way that suggests that SoundCloud or any artist, audio creator or other third party endorses or supports your website, or your use of the Players or Widget.
The foregoing shall apply whether such use is commercial or non-commercial.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>SoundCloud reserves the right to block your use of the Players and the Widget at any time and for any reason at its sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Subscriptions and gift codes
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Certain features of the Platform are only available to registered users who subscribe to a "Pro" or "Next Pro" plan (together, <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Pro Accounts"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) or to SoundCloud Go (Pro Accounts and SoundCloud Go are each referred to as a <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Subscription"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The purchase of Pro Accounts and gift codes related to Pro Accounts is subject to additional terms, which you will find here.
In addition, the purchase of subscriptions for SoundCloud Go is subject to additional terms, which you will find here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Pro Account Terms and the SoundCloud Go Terms include, amongst other things, terms relating to payment, the conclusion, renewal and cancellation of your Subscription, including your right of cancellation during the first 14 days of your Subscription, and certain technical usage limitations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Pro Account Terms are applicable to Pro and Next Pro Account users and the SoundCloud Go Terms are applicable to SoundCloud Go users in addition to these general Terms of Use when they purchase a Subscription.
SoundCloud reserves the right to limit the availability of SoundCloud Go subscriptions to specific jurisdictions as may be determined by SoundCloud in its sole discretion from time to time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Changes to the Platform, accounts and pricing
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>SoundCloud reserves the right at any time and for any reason to suspend, discontinue, terminate or cease providing access to the Platform or any part thereof, temporarily or permanently, and whether in its entirety or with respect to individual territories only.
In the case of any temporary or permanent suspension, discontinuation, termination or cessation of access, SoundCloud shall use its reasonable endeavors to notify registered users of such decision in advance.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You hereby agree that SoundCloud and its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers and shareholders shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any changes or modifications to the Website, Apps and/or any Services that SoundCloud may wish to make from time to time, or for any decision to suspend, discontinue or terminate the Website, the Services or any part or parts thereof, or your possibility to use or access the same from or within any territory or territories.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>SoundCloud may change the features of any type of account, may withdraw or, or introduce new features, products or types of account at any time and for any reason, and may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time.
In the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription.
In all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud® account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance.
You will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the Termination section below during such six (6) week period, your continued use of your account after the end of that six (6) week period will constitute your acceptance of the changes to your Subscription.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
