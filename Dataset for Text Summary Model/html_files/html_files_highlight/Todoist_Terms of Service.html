Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be billed on the same day each month).
The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account.
Doist or its third party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information).
You may cancel the Subscription Service by following the instructions provided at the following links for Todoist Premium, Todoist Business, and Twist, or by contacting us at support@todoist.com or support@twist.com (depending on which Doist Service product you are using).</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/li&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span></hypothesis-highlight>
