Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The place of arbitration shall be Santa Clara County, California.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/li&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span>

Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
Neither you nor Khan Academy will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.
No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>(e) Arbitration Procedures.
Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>JAMS Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.
You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>(f) Arbitration Fees.
Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.
If Khan Academy files, then Khan Academy will pay.
if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.
Each party will bear the expense of that party's attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
