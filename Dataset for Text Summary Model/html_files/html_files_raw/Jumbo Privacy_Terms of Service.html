<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>3.2.
Privacy Management<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Jumbo Privacy allows You to manage Your privacy settings within Your Accounts by showing You how Your information is used by the Account You select, by following this process :<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When You choose an Account to inspect, Jumbo Privacy will respond to Your request and review the use of Your data by the selected Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Jumbo Privacy then tells You what data is processed by Your Account, where You can find this data and then offers to delete the data You no longer wish to have processed in Your Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>These are simple suggestions made following Your request to inspect the data processed in Your Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Jumbo App’s proposals are based on what is technically possible to do but no guarantee is given as to the practical application of these requests on Your Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You are under no obligation to follow these suggestions, You can either simply read the result of the research or do nothing.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the respect of Your choices made in Your Account.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If You enable the “Block Tracker” Feature in the Jumbo App, Jumbo Privacy will block connections to servers you have selected by enabling an extension that will appear as a “VPN” on your phone.
Please note that contrary to a VPN, this extension does not encrypt traffic made on your phone.
You can turn this feature off at any time directly in the Jumbo App or through the iOS or Android device settings.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You are the one responsible to choose which trackers you want to block at any time by selecting or deselecting a tracker in your Jumbo App.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You acknowledge and agree that Jumbo Privacy has relied on lists available online from privacy experts’ blogs to decide what trackers to enable you to block or not (notably the list available here).
Therefore, Jumbo Privacy gives no warranty on whether such trackers are effectively tracking your data, and misusing it, and whether you should or not disable them by using the “Block Tracker” feature.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When using this feature, you acknowledge and agree that the process used to block these trackers cannot determine the origin of a connection attempt and as such may occasionally block content you were trying to access.
This is an unwanted side effect of this feature and cannot be completely avoided.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>3.4.
