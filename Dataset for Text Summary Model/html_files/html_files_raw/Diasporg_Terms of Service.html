Here are the important things you need to know about accessing and using the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>diaspora*<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> (https://diasp.org/) website and service (collectively, "Service").
These are our terms of service ("Terms").
Please read them carefully.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Privacy Policy <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
For information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our privacy policy.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Third-Party Services <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
From time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control.
Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party.
Your use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that partyâ€™s own terms of service or privacy policies.
We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website or service that you visit or use.
Note that while <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>diaspora*<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> itself does not work directly with advertisers, third party applications may contain advertising or marketing materials provided by such third parties.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Creating Accounts <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
When you create an account, you may use any name (real, fake or otherwise) for other users to see.
However, if you create a "parody" account of a real living person, you must clearly label your account as such.
Accounts that are not clearly marked as such and that impersonate other people without permission can be deleted without warning.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
Supporting the pod is not optional, donation or other help is required for using this server.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
When you create an account you only create one account, multiple accounts for spam or placeholders will be deleted and you will be banned.
Accounts are intended for real users to use for real purposes.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
When you create an account you also agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account data and any other information you provide to <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>diaspora*<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible.
For security holes in the diaspora* software itself, please contact the developers directly.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Your Content &amp;amp.
Conduct <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
Our Service allows you and other users to post, link and otherwise make available content.
You are responsible for the content that you make available to the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
When you post, link or otherwise make available content to the Service, you grant us the right and license to display and distribute your content on or through the Service (including via applications).
We may format your content for display throughout the Service, but we will not edit or revise the substance of your content itself.
The displaying and distribution of your content happens strictly only according to the visibility rules you have set for the content.
We will not modify the visibility of the content you have set.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
We cannot be held responsible should a programming or administrative error make your content visible to a larger audience than you had intended.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
Aside from our limited right to your content, you retain all of your rights to the content you post, link and otherwise make available on or through the Service.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
You can remove the content that you posted by deleting it.
Once you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time.
Web server access logs might also be stored for some time in the system.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
Since diaspora* is a distributed social network, it is possible, depending on the visibility rules set to your content, that your content has been distributed to other diaspora* pods.
When you delete your content, we will request those other pods to also delete the content.
Our responsibility on the content being deleted from those other pods ends here.
If for some reason, some other pod does not delete the content, we cannot be held responsible.
