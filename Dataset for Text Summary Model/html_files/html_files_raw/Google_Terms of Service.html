As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services.
For example, these terms include the following topic headings:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.
