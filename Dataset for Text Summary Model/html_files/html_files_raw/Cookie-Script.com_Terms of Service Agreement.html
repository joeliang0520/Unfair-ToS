The Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cookie-Script Services allow you to display a pop-up notification box(the “Pop-up”), that can be used on your website for different purposes.
It may be used to inform your website visitors (“End Users”) about your website Privacy Policy and Cookie usage.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cookie-Script is only the service provider and it is your own responsibility to ensure correct settings and implementation of Cookie-Script is used on your website in case you use it to comply with a certain law, regulation or directive, including but not limited to EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and EU’s ePrivacy Directive.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cookie-Script offers a set of options for the Pop-up, which is constantly updating to ensure Services cover as much customer needs as possible.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cookie-Script organizes server resources in a way to provide a high level of service with at least 99.9% uptime on the operation of the cloud service, both website and scripts hosting.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>3.
Membership subscriptions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Purchasing a membership will give you access to additional Cookie-Script functionality and premium support.
All functionality you get is described on Pricing Page.
By purchasing a paid membership, you agree that:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>There is no warranty or in any other way any form of liability on the side of Cookie-Script.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Cookie-Script reserves the right to offer discounts or permanent price changes at any moment, without prior notice.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The account that purchased the membership, cannot be shared.
Sharing or other methods that allow for multiple users to access the same account are strictly forbidden and may result in termination of the account and support.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>3.1.
Free membership<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Free Membership users are not allowed to download or modify JavaScript files used to show cookie pop-up warning messages.
Violation of those rules may result in termination of the account and support that comes with Free Membership.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Free Membership user’s Pop-up displays a copyright text with a link to cookie-script.com which is not allowed to be removed.
Trying to modify source code and remove links to cookie-script.com may result in termination of account and free support.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>3.2.
Paid memberships<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Users that have purchased functionality to self-host JavaScript files are allowed to download/modify/publish JavaScript files that are used to show cookie pop-up warning message to fit user's purposes without any prior notice.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Paid Membership users can also download un-minified JavaScript files, which gives them full control over Cookie-Script JavaScript code.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Paid Membership duration, price, and other limitations are described on the&amp;nbsp;Pricing page and can be modified without prior notice.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your Paid Membership limitations and functionality is locked to your account during purchase and will not be changed later during the membership period.
After the membership period finishes and needs to be renewed, the latest limitations and prices from the Pricing page will be applied to your membership.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Cookie-Script feature limitation policy is targeted to keep all the existing functionality user currently has and only include more functionality with every update.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>3.

Some information available in PayPal and Stripe is stored on PayPal/Stripe as part of transaction history.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If the Paid Membership period is limited, a periodic payment will be automatically created in PayPal/Stripe to extend your membership when the initial membership period is over.
You can cancel this automatic periodic payment directly in PayPal or in your Cookie-Script account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The exact price to be charged is calculated automatically using prices from Pricing page and provided billing information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The final charge, including all taxes, will be displayed before the order is made.
The amount of VAT, which may be added to the charge, is 21% of the total billing amount and will be added depending on the location and legal entity of the purchaser.
According to the European Union Council Directive 2006/112/EC, 21% VAT will be added if the purchaser<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>is from Lithuania<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
