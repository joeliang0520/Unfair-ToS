Enforcement
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The company reserves the right to change, redact, and delete content on the forum for any reason.
If you believe someone has submitted content to the forum in violation of these terms, contact us immediately.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Your Account
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must create and log into an account to use some features of the forum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself.
If you create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address, and to keep that address up-to-date.
You may close your account at any time by e-mailing contact [at] amethystcraft [dot] com.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the company that your account has been compromised.
You agree to notify the company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised.
You agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Your Content
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum</hypothesis-highlight>.
Nothing in these terms gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you submit to the forum.
<hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company.</hypothesis-highlight>
These terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.
But at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum.
That special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company’s backups, caches, and other systems.
Our backups are typicly removed 7 days after their creation, unless downloaded by us for any other reason, typicly server migration, in which case these backups will be removed from our systems once imported or otherwise utilized.
<hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">Other licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.</hypothesis-highlight>
<hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again</hypothesis-highlight>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.
You agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Your Responsibility
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.
Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.
If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.
You agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.
The company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Disclaimers
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The forum may hyperlink to and integrate forums and services run by others.

Limits on Liability
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Neither the company nor its suppliers will be liable to you for breach-of-contract damages their personnel could not have reasonably foreseen when you agreed to these terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>As far as the law allows, the total liability to you for claims of any kind that are related to the forum or content on the forum will be limited to $0.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

Otherwise, that provision should be removed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may not assign your agreement with the company.
The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.
Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum.
These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
