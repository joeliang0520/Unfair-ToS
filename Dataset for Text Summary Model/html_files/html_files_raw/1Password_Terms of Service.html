These Terms apply to all visitors, users, customers, and others who access or use the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Description of Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The “Service” means (a) AgileBits’ password managing, secure document storing, administrative and related systems and technologies, as well as the website https://1password.com (the “Site”), and (b) all software (including the Software, as defined below), applications, data, text, images, and other content made available by or on behalf of AgileBits.
Any modifications to the Service are also subject to these Terms.
AgileBits reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service or any feature or functionality thereof at any time without notice.
All rights, title and interest in and to the Service will remain with and belong exclusively to AgileBits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Subscriptions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription(s)").
You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”).
Billing cycles are set on a regular basis, typically monthly or yearly.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or AgileBits, Inc.
cancels it.
You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting AgileBits, Inc.
customer support team.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription.
You shall provide AgileBits, Inc.
or its third-party payment processor, with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, and valid payment method information.
By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize AgileBits, Inc.
to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
All amounts paid are non-refundable.
You further agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by your financial institution and intermediaries.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>At any time and without notice, AgileBits, Inc.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>AgileBits, Inc.
will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>While all amounts paid are non-refundable, certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by AgileBits, Inc.

In the event of such a termination we will provide you with the ability to take your data with you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>There are three very limited circumstances in which we will be unable to send notice to you prior to terminating your access to our Services: (i) you are in material breach of these Terms in such a way as to immediately and seriously endanger us and other users.
(ii) we are unable to send you notice because this would cause us legal liability or a disruption to our Service.
and (iii) we are unable to notify you due to law.
If we terminate your account for the reasons outlined in i-iii, then we will work with you to ensure you retain copies of your data, wherever permitted by law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>All provisions of the Terms shall survive termination, including without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
