<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Greetings players,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These terms of service (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) set out the terms and conditions by which Riot Games offers you access to use and enjoy our games, apps, websites and other services (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Riot Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Riot Games is a global gaming company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices and operations around the world.
When we say “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Riot Games<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>,” we’re referring to the Riot Games entity responsible for providing the Riot Services in your region (see Section 19, below) and these Terms are an agreement between you and that entity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please read these Terms carefully and pay particular attention to these items:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Dispute Resolution.
If you reside in the United States, please read the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver in Part A of Section 17.
It affects how disputes between us are resolved.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Virtual Content<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
When you click to purchase, earn or are gifted Virtual Content, you only get a license to access Virtual Content.
You have no ownership in any of the Virtual Content you unlock and you can’t transfer it to someone else.
Virtual Content has no monetary value, is generally game specific and you can’t redeem Virtual Content for any type of “real world” money.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Refund Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
You lose the right to change your mind, cancel the order and get a refund if you get immediate access to or download your digital content.
There are some exceptions to this rule, but we have a strict policy on refunds.
Read about it here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

You agree to follow our User Rules (Section 7).
These rules govern both in-game behavior and certain out-of-game conduct while using the Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Attention Parents! <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We provide game rating info on our website about age appropriateness.
We also encourage you to supervise your child’s online activities, review the content they are accessing and, as appropriate, monitor their social interactions.

YOUR ACCOUNT 1.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Am I eligible to create an account and use the Riot Services?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (You either must be an adult or have permission from your parents or legal guardian.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To create an account and use the Riot Services, you must: (i) be an adult.
(ii) be an emancipated minor.
or (iii) have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms.
If you’re not an adult or emancipated minor, or don’t understand this section, please talk to your parents or legal guardian and ask for help.
If you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor who creates an account with us, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.
You are also responsible for all use of the account and compliance with these Terms by the minor, including all purchases made on the account.
You may not create or use an account or use any of the Riot Services on behalf of any other person or other legal entity or for a commercial purpose.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Do I need to provide my real name and stuff?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Yes.
Please don’t try to pull any kind of “Definitely Not Blitzcrank” or “Definitely Not Udyr” funny business.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>I have a ton of different email accounts.
Does it matter which one I use to register my account?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Yes.
Otherwise, you might miss important notices!)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We send account, legal and service related notices to the email address registered to your account.
These notifications may be really important (e.g., a notification that we intend to terminate your account for inactivity) so you must keep the email address associated with your account current and (if we ask) verified.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Can I share or sell my account or login credentials?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you create an account with us, we require you to select a unique username and password (collectively, your “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Login Credentials<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
You agree that:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You can’t share your account or Login Credentials with anyone.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You can’t sell, transfer or allow any other person to access your account or Login Credentials, or offer to do so.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must keep your Login Credentials secret.

ACCOUNT TERMINATION 2.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>How can my account be suspended or terminated?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (If you break the rules, Demacian Justice will be visited upon your account!)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>2.1.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>You.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You may terminate or suspend your account at any time by contacting us at support@riotgames.com .<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>2.1.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may terminate or suspend your account without notice to you if we reasonably determine, that: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you have breached any part of these Terms (including the User Rules);<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>doing so would be in the best interests of our community or the Riot Services or is required for upholding a third party’s rights;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>we have stopped offering the Riot Services in your region (though we’ll normally post advance notice on our website, app or game if we plan to stop offering a material core feature of a game or all of the Riot Services in your region);<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you have failed to pay any fees you owe us (except in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct) or we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your account.
or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you have (or we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you have) made unauthorized use of someone else’s payment info.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We can make such determinations, with the assistance of automated systems and machine learning tools or by using other methods that we think are appropriate.
If you think that we have made a mistake, please Contact Us with details and we will review your case, though we may suspend your account during our review.
You can also challenge our determinations (see Section 17).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
2.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Will Riot maintain my account forever, even if I stop using it?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (If you abandon your account for a very long period of time, we may terminate it after giving you notice and an opportunity to re-activate it.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you do not use your account for a prolonged period of time, we reserve the right to take measures against your account, including suspension or termination.
If we plan to take measures against your account based on prolonged period of inactivity, we will let you know first (e.g., by email to the email address registered to your account) and give you ample opportunity to avoid such measures (e.g., deletion of your account).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
2.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What happens if Riot terminates my account?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No games for you and you will lose access to any purchases including Game Currency and Virtual Goods.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If your account is terminated, you’ll no longer have access to your account, including any of the associated data or Virtual Content (including Game Currency) (though this does not limit or affect any rights you have under data or consumer protection laws).
Where we terminate for a legitimate reason (e.g.
where you have breached these Terms):<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you’ll not be entitled to any refunds and we’ll have no liability to you.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>we also reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created, as well as your access to any other Riot Services (also without any refunds or liability to you).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
&amp;nbsp.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You understand and agree that using the Riot Services comes with the risk that your account may be terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms and that, whenever you use the Riot Services, you’ll bear this risk in mind and always conduct yourself appropriately.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 3.
LIMITED LICENSE 3.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What can I do with the Riot Services?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (You can enjoy the Riot Services for your own, personal, non-commercial use.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use and enjoy the Riot Services (and any Virtual Content) for your individual, non-commercial, entertainment purposes only and expressly conditioned upon your compliance with these Terms.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="2829" data-revision="latest" data-offset="9686">
If we terminate your account, any license granted by us to you in the Riot Services and any Virtual Content ends immediately.
Unless otherwise expressly authorized by us in a signed written contract, you may not sell, copy, exchange, loan, reverse engineer, decompile, derive source code from, translate, lease, grant a security interest in, transfer, publish, assign or otherwise distribute any of the Riot Services or any of Riot Games’ intellectual property, including any of our computer code or Virtual Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Can I do stuff with Riot’s intellectual property?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (We reserve all the rights to our IP, but do allow for some personal, non-commercial uses, like fan art.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We (and our licensors) own and reserve all rights, title and interest in and to the Riot Services, and all data and content posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available in or through the Riot Services, including, user accounts, computer code, titles, objects, artifacts, characters, character names, chat logs, game recordings and broadcasts, locations, location names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, artwork, graphics, structural or landscape designs, animations, sounds, musical compositions and recordings, virtual goods, in-game currency, audio-visual effects, character likenesses, methods of operation and gameplay (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Game Content<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
For clarity, Game Content includes Virtual Content.
You can’t create any work of authorship based on the Game Content or Riot Services except as expressly permitted by us.
For more info about what fan uses we currently permit, please read our Legal Jibber Jabber policy (though be aware that we change this from time to time).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You also agree that unless we grant you a license, in a written contract signed by us, you may never use any of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, taglines, or trade dress.
Any reproduction, redistribution, or modification of the Riot Services, or use of the Riot Services not in accordance with these Terms, is expressly prohibited and may result in severe civil and/or criminal penalties.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 4.
VIRTUAL GOODS, GAME CURRENCY AND PURCHASES 4.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What is Virtual Content?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Virtual content includes stuff like game currency and virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes, accessories, etc.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When using the Riot Services, we may provide you with opportunities to acquire a limited license to access virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes, etc., (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Virtual Goods<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) and in-game currency (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Game Currency<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), associated with your account (collectively, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Virtual Content<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Game Currency may only be used for the specific game for which it was purchased unless we say otherwise at the time of purchase.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 4.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>How do I get a “license” to access Virtual Content?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Buy it, earn it, or receive it.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may provide you with various opportunities to acquire a limited license to access Game Currency or Virtual Content, including:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>purchasing it (e.g., with a credit card).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>earning it (e.g., by accomplishing game missions or tasks).
or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>receiving it (e.g., from another player as a gift or using crafting functionality like Hextech®).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
4.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Do I “own” the Virtual Content I unlock?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.
What you “unlock” is not the virtual good itself, but rather, a non-transferable limited license to access it.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You have no ownership or other property interest in any of the Virtual Content you unlock, regardless of how you acquired access to it.
Virtual Content has no monetary value.
You can’t transfer (unless we allow it in the functionality of the Riot Services) or redeem Virtual Content for any type of “real world” money.
You can’t obtain any refunds for purchasing a license to access Virtual Content, except as expressly permitted by us.
You can find our current content refund policy here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
4.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Once again: I don’t <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>own<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> my Virtual Content?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (“No!” shouted all the lawyers.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you obtain Virtual Content from us, what we are actually giving you is a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable, limited right and license to use that Virtual Content only in connection with your use of the applicable Riot Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in your account, and that all rights in and to your account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of Riot Games.
You further acknowledge and agree that you have no title, ownership, or other proprietary interest in any Virtual Content, regardless of any consideration offered or paid in exchange.
Furthermore, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence, or to the extent these Terms say otherwise, Riot Games shall not be liable in any manner for the destruction, deletion, modification, impairment, hacking, or any other damage or loss of any kind caused to Virtual Content, including the deletion of Virtual Content upon the termination or expiration of your account or our reasonable changes to the Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
4.5.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Will my Virtual Content always be available?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Not necessarily, no.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In an effort to constantly improve the Riot Services, evolve our games and keep the Riot Services, safe, fun, and secure, we have the right to delete, alter, move, remove, re-package, re-price, or transfer any and all Game Content, including Virtual Content, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.
For example, your Virtual Goods may (and likely will) evolve over time to improve the Riot Services or for regulatory or legal reasons.
If we decide to entirely retire certain Virtual Goods that you recently purchased, we will provide you with a replacement.
We won’t delete your Game Currency without notice (such as through posts on our website, app or game), unless your account is terminated by us for a legitimate reason or by you under Section 2.1.1.
We may sometimes change the purchasing power of Game Currency (for example, we might increase the number of Game Currency needed to purchase Virtual Goods, such as skins).
We normally only do this in incremental steps but we’ll give you notice (such as through posts on our website, app or game) if we plan to make changes that will significantly impact your Game Currency in a negative way.
We don’t provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaim, any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers we operate or control, including any Game Content or Virtual Content attributed to your account.
If we allow the sale or transfer of your right to access certain Game Content or Virtual Content, it may only be conducted via services approved or provided by us, if any.

FEES &amp;amp.
TAXES 5.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Is everything about the Riot Services free?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some aspects of the Riot Services may require you to pay a fee, and you agree that you’ll provide accurate and complete payment info to us or the third-party payment provider used by us.
You further agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred on your account.
We may revise the pricing for any part of the Riot Services at any time.
This can impact on the purchasing power of your Game Currency, though we normally only do this in incremental steps.
All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes due and payable.
We may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement our fees and fee-billing methods, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting in these Terms or elsewhere on our websites, apps or in our games.
Except in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct, if you fail to pay any fees you owe to us or we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your account, we may suspend or terminate your account.
See Section 2 (Account Termination) for more info.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Subject to applicable law, any applicable fees and other charges for fee-based services (including Game Currency) are payable in advance and aren’t refundable in whole or in part except as expressly provided in these Terms.
Except in cases of Riot’s gross negligence, or willful misconduct or to the extent these Terms say otherwise, you’re fully liable for all charges to your account, including any unauthorized charges.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Pay applicable taxes.
verify that all transactions with us are correct, etc.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You’re solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to acquiring, using, or accessing Game Currency.
Game Currency may be sold or issued by us in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you’re purchasing.
As we feel it necessary, in our reasonable discretion (or as prescribed by law), we may limit the total amount of Game Currency that may be purchased for any one game or that may be held in your account in the aggregate.
Additionally, price and availability of Game Currency and Virtual Goods are subject to change.
We may restrict how much Game Currency you can purchase and/or use based on your location as we have different approaches in different locations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You should verify that the proper amount of Game Currency has been added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction.
Please notify us immediately if you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Game Currency balance.
We’ll investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional info to verify it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 6.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> 17.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>If we have a dispute, can we 1 v 1 instead?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No, we should negotiate first.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties (justice doesn’t come on swift wings outside Valoran).
In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to these Terms (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Claim<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except as set out in Section 17.4 below).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>How does negotiation get started?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (One of us sends the other one a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your account.
If you don’t have an account with Riot Games, we will send the notice to the email address which you used to write to us about the Claim.
You must send your notice to the Riot Games entity that is responsible for providing the Riot Services to you (see Section 19 for contact details).
Please note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What claims are we agreeing to submit to negotiation?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Depends on the type of dispute)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and without limiting your statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding, you and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the other provisions in this Part A concerning negotiations: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games’ intellectual property rights.
(ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use.
and (iii) any Claim for equitable relief (such as an injunction).
In addition, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction instead of litigation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Part B: Dispute Resolution for North, Central or South America (excluding Brazil)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> 17.5.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What the heck is arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (A private dispute resolution method.
No courtrooms or juries.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a sitting judge or jury.
Arbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes privately and without the formality of going to court.
Arbitration follows different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited review by courts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.6.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Will arbitration allow for the same type of relief as a court?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Yes.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The arbitrator’s decision (called an “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Award<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the Award is based.
The Award will be final and binding upon the parties, may be confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then enforced like any other court order or judgment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.7.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What claims are we agreeing to submit to arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>

A sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to these rules.
Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.11.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>How does arbitration get started?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (One of us sends the other one and JAMS a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Either party may commence an arbitration proceeding.
The party commencing the arbitration is called the “claimant.” A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party.
JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration on its website.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.12.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Who’s gonna pay for the arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (We pay filing fees for lesser claims, but you have to pay filing fees for larger claims.
We won’t seek attorney fees for arbitration from you unless your claim is found to be frivolous.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules.
We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.13.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Where and how will the arbitration take place?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Over the phone, in writing, or in your hometown—your choice.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed location.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.14.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What about intellectual property infringement?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Either party may go to court for the limited purpose of seeking a “provisional” remedy.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Either party may seek emergency provisional remedies, including injunctive or similar relief, pursuant to the JAMS rules or from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Los Angeles County, California, where necessary to protect that party’s rights and interests for the infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights pending the appointment of an arbitrator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.15.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Can either of us tell our friends and Twitter followers about the arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Nope.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You and Riot Games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings including any settlement agreement, shall be kept confidential.
However, the prevailing party in any arbitration may file the arbitration Award with any court of competent jurisdiction in order to have that Award confirmed in a court order or judgment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
17.16.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What if part of this agreement to arbitrate isn’t enforceable?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (The rest stays—we keep as much of it as can be enforced under the law.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You and Riot Games agree that if any part of this arbitration agreement is declared unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the remainder of this arbitration agreement shall be given full force and effect.
However, if Section 17.8, above (entitled, “Can I bring a class action claim?”), or any part of it is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement (i.e., all of Part A of Section 17) shall be severed from these Terms and all claims between you and Riot Games shall be exclusively decided by a court located in Los Angeles County, California as set out in the relevant part of Section 16 above.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Part C: Dispute Resolution for South Korea<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any dispute arising under these Terms or Riot Services will be brought in the court having jurisdiction in accordance with the Code of Korean Civil Procedure.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Part D: Dispute Resolution for Japan<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Tokyo District Court shall have the exclusive jurisdiction in the first instance over any dispute between Riot Games and you arising out of, or in connection with, these Terms or any Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Part E: Dispute Resolution for SEA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any dispute, controversy, claim or difference of any kind whatsoever arising out of or in connection with these Terms or Riot Services shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>SIAC<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>SIAC Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this Section.
The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore.
The Tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators and the language of the arbitration shall be English.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Part F: Dispute Resolution for EEA Residents<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
17.17.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Do I have other dispute resolution options?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you live in the EEA, you may refer the dispute to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution Platform (see ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Within a year after you submit your complaint to us, you may also try to resolve your dispute with Riot Games through a mediation procedure.
This does not limit your statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 18.
ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO RIOT SERVICES 18.1.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>General Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may access Riot Services we make available from certain authorized third party stores or platforms (an authorized third party provider of any store, game system, console or platform each a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Third Party Platform<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), only if you agree that: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>These Terms are an agreement between us and you, and not between you and the Third Party Platform.
As between Riot Games and the Third Party Platform, Riot Games is solely responsible for any Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Third Party Platform has no obligation to provide any maintenance and support services for the Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Third Party Platform is not responsible for addressing any claims you have relating to the Riot Services or your possession and use of the Riot Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If a third party claims any of the Riot Services infringes another party's intellectual property rights, as between the Third Party Platform and Riot Games, the Third Party Platform will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such claim.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Third Party Platform and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as they relate to your license to the Riot Services.
Upon your acceptance of these Terms, the Third Party Platform will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Section 18 and Section 20.9 as related to your license of the Riot Services against you as a third-party beneficiary.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service and licenses when accessing or using the the Third Party Platform including any additional terms that apply when you download, stream, access or use any Riot game, Virtual Content or other Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> 19.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What can I do if I have questions about the Riot Services?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Until the day we can establish a Yordle call center, you can email us.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you have any questions concerning the Riot Services, or if you would like to contact us for any other reason, please contact Riot Games support at support@riotgames.com.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.2.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Can either party assign these Terms?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.

20.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Is this our entire agreement?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Yes, including those other important policies we talked about earlier.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms represent the complete agreement between you and Riot Games concerning the Riot Services, and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Riot Games.
These Terms shall coexist with, and shall not supersede any other Riot Games policies referenced in these Terms.
You and Riot Games agree that we each have not relied upon, and have no remedies in respect of, any terms, conditions, representations, warranties or similar that are not expressly set out in these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.4.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What happens if a natural disaster interferes with the Game?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Riot isn’t liable.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Riot Games shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform, including any failure to perform under these Terms due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Riot Games’ control such as: (a) hacking, cyber-attacks, data corruption/loss (where we have taken the steps that would reasonably be taken by companies like us to avoid this event occurring).
or (b) acts of god, war, terrorism, bomb-threats, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.5.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Do these Terms mean we’re partners?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Not in a legal sense, no.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Riot Games as a result of these Terms or your use of the Riot Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.6.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>If I breach these Terms and Riot does nothing for a long time, does that mean I’m off the hook?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.
We reserve all of our rights.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

Any waiver by Riot Games of any provision, condition or requirement of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.7.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>What remedies are available to Riot Games if I breach these Terms?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that Riot Games would suffer irreparable harm if a breach of certain of these Terms (such as Section 3.2) was not specifically enforced and that damages would not be an adequate remedy for Riot Games as a result.
We may rely upon this Section to ask a court for injunctive relief or specific performance.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.8.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>If I need to send a legal notice to Riot, where do I send it?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (We hope you never need to send us a legal notice, but if you do….)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, all notices given by you or required under these Terms shall be in writing and addressed to the Riot Games entity that provides you with the Riot Services at issue.
See Section 19 for the address of the relevant Riot Games entity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.9.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Can I play the Game if the U.S.
government thinks I might be a terrorist or I live in an embargoed country?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Much of the Riot Services are developed in the U.S.
so you cannot use them if: (1) the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Treasury Department lists you as a specially designated national and/or blocked person.
(2) the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce lists you on its denied persons list or lists of parties of concern.
or (3) you’re on any similar list promulgated by an official agency or department of the United States government.
You warrant and represent that you’re not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any embargoed country.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.10.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>If part of these Terms is invalidated, what happens to the rest?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (Like Zac, these Terms might lose a part or two, but what’s left lives on.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be considered severed from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.11.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Are these silly headings legally binding? <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (No.
These headings are just our lawyers’ way of trying to be engaging and funny.
Other lawyers find these headings to be appropriately engaging and funny.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The headings and parentheticals in these Terms are provided for informational and entertainment purposes only.
They have no legal effect whatsoever.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
20.12.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>How long does this agreement last?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> (For as long as you use the Riot Services or until your account is terminated.
Some provisions have been chronoshifted, though, and last forever.)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
