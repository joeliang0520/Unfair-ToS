The Pet Friend software is a software as a service (SaaS).
The software is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE".
Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Your Content in our Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content.
You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content.
In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Modifying and Terminating our Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
You can stop using our service at any time.
We reserve the right to terminate service within reason if we find you are violating or misusing our services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Our Warranties and Disclaimers<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them.
But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, NEITHER The Pet Friend NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.
WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.
SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Liability for our Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, The Pet Friend, AND The Pet Friend’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF The Pet Friend, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE SERVICES AGAIN).
IN ALL CASES, The Pet Friend, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> About these Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services.
You should look at the terms regularly.
We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page.
We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service.
Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.
If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
These terms control the relationship between The Pet Friend and you.
They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
The laws of Ohio, U.S.A., excluding Ohio’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.
All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Franklin County, Ohio, USA, and you and The Pet Friend consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Billing and Cancellation<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>1.
Billing Cycle.
The membership fee for the Pet Friend service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page.
The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service.
Membership fees are fully earned upon payment.
In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.
Visit the Pet Friend.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on the "Account" page to see your next payment date.
We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.
If you signed up for Pet Friend using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Pet Friend membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>2.
Payment Methods.
To use the Pet Friend service you must provide one or more Payment Methods.
You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee.
You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.
For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.
Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>3.
Updating your Payment Methods.
You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page.
We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers.
Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>4.
Cancellation.
You can cancel your Pet Friend membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Pet Friend service through the end of your billing period.
To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our Pet Friend.com website and follow the instructions for cancellation.
If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.
To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page.
If you signed up for Pet Friend using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Pet Friend membership, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Pet Friend service through that third party.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>5.

Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>6.
No Refunds.
Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods.
Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.
At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits").
The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.
The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
