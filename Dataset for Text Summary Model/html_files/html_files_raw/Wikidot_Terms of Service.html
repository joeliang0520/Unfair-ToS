When new Terms are published they apply immediately to all unregistered users of the Services.
Registered users will be presented with the changes, and the option of accepting the new Terms, or canceling their account, at their next authenticated visit to the Services.
If you are a registered user and you choose to continue to use the Services, you agree to be bound by the new Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

We however assume no responsibility for monitoring any of the Wiki Sites for inappropriate content nor review any Content before it is posted.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You as a Wikidot.com User are solely responsible for the Content you post through any of the Services and any information or materials you transmit directly to other Users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The license will terminate at the time the Content is removed from the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This right is required for proper and legal operation of the Services.
The license does not allow us to do anything more that you would expect, e.g.
it does not give us the right to distribute your Content outside Wikidot Services or sell your content to anyone.
Although we might reuse Content from public wikis in various places such as "featured content" or "top wikis", we will not disclose any content from non-public (private) sites to unauthorized users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
