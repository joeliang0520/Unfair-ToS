Complaints &amp;amp.
Legal Challenges
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sometimes domain name registrations become the subject of a legal challenge.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>If Tucows is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or administrative body regarding your domain name, Tucows may, at its sole discretion, (a) suspend your ability to use, make modifications to, or transfer your registration records and/or (b) deposit control of your registration record with the appropriate judicial entity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Right to Limit Quantities Purchased
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right to limit quantities purchased to normal retail purchases.
