Charges and Payment<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.1.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> Pricing.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Certain Services are offered under different pricing plans, the limits and features of which are available at www.figma.com/pricing, and further governed by https://www.figma.com/pricing-faq/.
Your rights and obligations with respect to certain Services will be based in part on the pricing plan you choose.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.2.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> Payment Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.2.1.
When you purchase Services (each such purchase, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), you expressly authorize us or our third-party payment processor to charge you for such Services.
You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment methods that you provide to us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.2.2.
All fees are stated and solely payable in U.S.
Dollars, </div> <p></p>

You are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of the charges billed by us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.2.3.
In the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access to the Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies we may have.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Authorization for Recurring Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.1.
All pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any applicable taxes and other charges are a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscription Fee<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Depending on which options you choose, those fees may recur each month, quarter or year thereafter, at the then-current rate.
Please note that our fees are subject to change, although we will notify you before we effect any change.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.2.
By agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Figma.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">We (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Subscription (e.g., each month, quarter, or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription using the payment information you have provided.</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/p&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span></hypothesis-highlight>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.3.
In the event your Subscription begins on a day not contained in a later month, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem appropriate.
For example, if you started a monthly Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date.
We may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.3.4.
Your Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in accordance with these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>5.4.
Cancelling Subscriptions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.4.1.
You may cancel your Subscription at any time but please note that such cancellation will only be effective at the end of the then-current Subscription period.
Unless required by law, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.4.2.
To cancel, you can either (i) email us at support@figma.com and follow any instructions, if any, we provide to you in response to your cancellation request, or (ii) for some kinds of Subscriptions, initiate a cancellation through your Account settings within the Services.
You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees incurred for the then-current Subscription period.
Cancelling your Subscription will not terminate your Account.
See Section 10 (Termination) below for information on terminating your Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.5.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> Taxes.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Fees do not include taxes, and you agree to: (a) pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property, or other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and payments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our income, employees, or real property.
and (b) be responsible for any filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.6.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Withholding.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Further, all payments made by you to us under these Terms will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding.
If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required by law, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.
Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the other party to help obtain, reduce, or eliminate any necessary withholding, deduction, or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>6.
Confidentiality.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> Confidential Information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Discloser<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) have disclosed or may disclose proprietary or non-public business, technical, financial, or other information (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Confidential Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) to you (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Recipient<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
Our Confidential Information expressly includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Services, including security related information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.2<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> Obligations.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>The Recipient will use the Discloser’s Confidential Information only for the purpose of evaluating whether or not to use (or continue to use) the Services.
The Recipient will not disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information to parties other than the Recipient’s employees, contractors, affiliates, agents, or professional advisors (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Representatives<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) who need to know it and who have a legal obligation to keep it confidential.
The Recipient will ensure that its Representatives are subject to no less restrictive confidentiality obligations than those herein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Recipient may disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information: (a) if directed by Discloser.
or (b) to the extent required by applicable legal process, provided that the Recipient uses commercially reasonable efforts to (i) promptly notify the Discloser in advance, to the extent permitted by law, and (ii) comply with the Discloser’s reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose the disclosure.
The obligations set forth herein will survive for so long as these Terms are in effect between the parties and for five years thereafter.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>7.
Warranties.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.1.
In the event of any loss or corruption of any data associated with the Services, Figma will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the lost or corrupted data from the latest relevant backup maintained by Figma.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>EXCEPT FOR THE FOREGOING, FIGMA WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS, DESTRUCTION, ALTERATION, UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR CORRUPTION OF ANY DATA.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>What is arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury.
Instead, a neutral person (the “arbitrator”) hears each party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding on both parties.
The arbitrator can award the same relief as a court could, including monetary damages.
While court review of an arbitration award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator’s decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision enforced by a court.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Can a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>NO.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>What rules apply in the arbitration?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>AAA Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>How will the arbitration be conducted? How much does it cost?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and costs if we prevail in the arbitration.
The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference), in San Francisco, California, United States or at some other location that we both agree to.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
