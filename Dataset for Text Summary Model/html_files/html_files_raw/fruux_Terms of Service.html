<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> allows you to use its software/services free of charge with a limited set of features.
We reserve the right to terminate free accounts at any time.
If a free account remains inactive for ninety (90) days or has no current email address assigned to it then we reserve the right to terminate your account and delete any data stored on our servers without prior notice.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Paid Accounts <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> offers paid accounts with additional features upon payment of a fee.
Once an account has been converted to a paid account, it is no longer subject to the restrictions placed upon free accounts.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> accepts credit cards and will automatically bill your card according to your selected plan (monthly/yearly and/or based on your usage).
If the fees due are not paid within the allocated time period or if we cannot process your credit card with the information you provided then <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> reserves the right to cancel both access to your account and the data stored within that account.
If you do not pay any fees due within ten (10) days of us sending you a written due notice, then we reserve the right to downgrade your account to a free account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Billing <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Any fees for paid accounts will be charged on the day you upgrade your account.
If the paid account comes with a free trial period then nothing will be charged to you until this period is over (if you cancel your account within the trial period then no charges are due either).
Your account will renew after the initial charge either monthly or yearly (depending on which interval you have chosen), so long as you do not cancel it before the renewal payment is due.
In using our software/service, you agree that the amount billed for renewal payments may differ owing to (and is not limited to) reasons such as promotional offers, account changes (such as different features) and changes in any taxes due.
You also agree that we may charge your credit card on file with us for such varying amounts as well.
We may also periodically authorise your credit card in anticipation of any fees due.
All fees and charges relating to our software/services are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for part-used periods.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Cancelling your account <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Paid accounts will automatically renew unless cancelled by you or terminated by us.
In order to to avoid being billed for the preceding period, you must cancel your paid account <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>before<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> its renewal date (whether monthly or yearly, depending on your plan).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> accounts are prepaid and non-refundable.
No refunds or credits for any part-used periods (whether monthly or yearly) will be provided.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>fruux<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> accounts may be cancelled at any time and will remain effective until the period that has been paid for (and up till) ends.
