USE OF COPYRIGHT MATERIAL AND PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sites must not contain Warez, copyright or other illegal material
including links or redirects to copyright material hosted on 3rd party
websites / resources.
The onus is on you the customer to prove that you
own the rights to publish material, not for InfinityFree to prove that
you do not.
InfinityFree does not allow the propagation or distribution
of copyright material, files or warez under any circumstances.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
8.
ACCEPTABLE SERVER RESOURCE USE
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sites must not use excessive amounts of server resources.
These include
bandwidth, processor utilization and / or disk space.
Please see the
'High Resource Use Policy' in the General Terms and Conditions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

We
also do not provide free backups / archives of customers own current
data.

We may choose to
waive this fee under circumstances of our choosing.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
10.
SCRIPT USAGE TERMS
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Scripts on the site must be designed to produce web-based content, and
not to use the server as an application server.
Using the server to
generate large volumes of email from a database is an example of
activity that is not allowed.
Scripts should not attempt to manipulate
the timeouts on servers.
These are set at the present values to ensure
the reliability of the server.
Sites that reset these do so because they
are resource intensive, and adversely affect server performance and are
therefore not allowed.
Scripts that are designed to provide proxy
services, anonymous or otherwise, are not allowed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The primary purpose of any script must be to produce a web page.
Scripts
that send a single email based upon user entered information, or update
a database are acceptable.
Scripts that send bulk email or perform
processor intensive database processes are not allowed.
All outgoing
mail is monitored and filtered and must be sent to or from a
InfinityFree-hosted domain.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sites must not contain scripts that attempt to access privileged server
resources, or other sites on the same server<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Examples of not allowed script and website types include (but are not
limited to):<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Pornographic/adult content<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
11.
USAGE OF DISK SPACE TERMS
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>InfinityFree offers large web space and bandwidth with hosting accounts.
By this, we mean space for legitimate web site content and bandwidth for
visitors to view it.
All files on a domain must be part of the active
website and linked to the site.
Sites should not contain any backups,
downloads, or other non-web based content.
We will treat all password
protected archive (e.g.
zip and rar) files as unacceptable.
Multimedia
content such as audio and video is acceptable provided it is streamed to
the user, links to HTTP download of this content is not acceptable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Archives of movie files, audio files, zips, rars or any large volumes of
files used for downloading / sharing is not allowed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
12.
RIGHT TO SUSPEND / TERMINATE HOSTING SERVICES
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any hosting services if a
website/hosting service consumes excessive server resources or effects
other websites / hosting services on a shared or clustered hosting
server.
Excessive resource usage can constitute any form of server usage
calculated and determined at the discretion of InfinityFree.
InfinityFree reserves the right to suspend service at any time without
prior notice if or when the health or normal running / performance of a
service is effected / degraded by a website or hosting service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You acknowledge that InfinityFree may or may not pre-screen Content, but
that InfinityFree and its designees shall have the right (but not the
obligation) in their sole discretion to pre-screen, refuse, or remove
any Content that is available via the Service.
Without limiting the
foregoing, InfinityFree and its designees shall have the right to remove
any Content that violates the TOS or is otherwise objectionable.
You
agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the
use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy,
completeness, or usefulness of such Content.
In this regard, you
acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by InfinityFree
or submitted to InfinityFree, including without limitation information
in InfinityFree Message Boards and in all other parts of the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You acknowledge, consent and agree that InfinityFree may access,
preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
Service, including your Content, may involve<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

networks or devices.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You understand that the Service and software embodied within the Service
may include security components that permit digital materials to be
protected, and that use of these materials is subject to usage rules set
by InfinityFree and/or content providers who provide content to the
Service.
You may not attempt to override or circumvent any of the usage
rules embedded into the Service.
Any unauthorized reproduction,
publication, further distribution or public exhibition of the materials
provided on the Service, in whole or in part, is strictly prohibited.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
13.
INTERSTATE NATURE OF COMMUNICATIONS ON INFINITYFREE NETWORK
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you register with InfinityFree, you acknowledge that in using
InfinityFree services to send electronic communications (including but
not limited to email, uploading photos and files and other Internet
activities), you will be causing communications to be sent through
InfinityFree's computer networks, portions of which are located in
California, Ohio, UK, and other locations in the United States and
portions of which are located abroad.
As a result, and also as a result
of InfinityFree's network architecture and business practices and the
nature of electronic communications, even communications that seem to be
intrastate in nature can result in the transmission of interstate
communications regardless of where you are physically located at the
time of transmission.
Accordingly, by agreeing to this Terms of Service,
you acknowledge that use of the service results in interstate data
transmissions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the
country in which you reside.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
15.

By way of example, publicly
accessible areas of the Service would include InfinityFree Message
Boards and all areas that are open to both members and visitors.
However, publicly accessible areas of the Service would not include
portions of InfinityFree Servers that are limited to members,
InfinityFree services intended for private communication such as
InfinityFree Mail or, or areas off of the InfinityFree network of
properties such as portions of World Wide Web sites that are accessible
via hypertext or other links but are not hosted or served by
InfinityFree.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
15.
