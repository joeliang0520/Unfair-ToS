<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you open your account, we ask you for information which is required to open the account.&amp;nbsp.
If this information is not provided, your account opening will be delayed.&amp;nbsp.
We may ask you for additional information, from time to time, in addition to what you provided when you opened your account and if this information is not provided to meet our requirements this may result in your account being suspended or closed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>What should you know about your Curve account?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>E-money.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Your Curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an ATM.
Rest assured that your money is always kept separate from our own.
This is known as customer funds safeguarding.
It is required by law and ensures that your money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations or become insolvent.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>No interest.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>We’re not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you and they are <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>not protected <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>by the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Don’t worry: Curve is required to keep your funds safe in a safeguarding bank account, which means that all of your funds are protected.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>How it works.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You need to link and verify an eligible payment card to your Curve account in the Curve app, before you can use your Curve card.
The payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your Curve account.
We may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the Curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you make a transaction using your Curve card, Curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to Curve.
This is done for you automatically by the Curve processing system (no hassle to you).
The amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction (including for any Curve services provided).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The loaded funds are used to issue e-money which is loaded onto your Curve e-money account and are then used to pay for the transaction made with your Curve card.
If your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will be declined.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In case Curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the Curve app, we may try to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards (for more information on how to set this up, go here)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can add multiple payment cards to the Curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the Curve app.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Each time you link a payment card to your Curve account you’re giving us a continuous authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.
Curve will use various means to identify that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can see your transactions on the timeline in the Curve app.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>What should you know about your Curve card?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Curve will issue you either a personal or business Curve Card, based on the purpose of the card use you selected during the sign-up process.
It will either be a physical and/or digital card.
A digital card is a card where you can see your Curve card details in the Curve app only, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the Fee Schedule).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can use your Curve card to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online.
To withdraw cash, you will&amp;nbsp.
need a physical Curve card.
Please note that you cannot withdraw cash at an ATM if you have your Curve Cash card selected as a funding source for the Curve card.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>What type of accounts can you open?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Personal or business.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Curve offers both<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>personal and&amp;nbsp.
business accounts.
You can only open a business account if you are a sole-trader or a self-employed natural person and intend to use your Curve account exclusively for business spend.
You cannot open a business account for a company or partnership.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We can suspend your account or change it from business to personal if we reasonably think it is not being used for business purposes.
If we change your account type, we will issue you with a replacement card.
.
From time to time, we may request further information from you, to verify your business status and business spend.
Please note that the use of a Curve business account for personal spend is not permitted under these Terms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you have a business account but wish to use Curve for personal reasons, you must contact us to change your account type.
There is no cost to you for this change.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Minimum subscription periods<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you subscribe to Curve Black or Metal, you can choose to pay monthly or annually.
Depending on which you choose, minimum subscription periods apply.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>If you choose to pay monthly,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> the minimum subscription period is 6 months.
If you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount paid for the current month of the subscription.
If you cancel your subscription and it is less than 4 months since the start of it, you must give us 2 months’ advance notice (such notice period to run from the end of your current subscription month).
You do not need to give us advance notice if you want to cancel and it is more than 4 months since the start of it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>If you choose to pay annually<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>, the minimum subscription period is 12 months.
This minimum subscription period will apply each time your subscription is renewed.
If you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount of the annual subscription fee.
You do not need to give us advance notice to cancel your subscription.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In all cases where your subscription is subject to a minimum subscription period (whether 6 months because you pay monthly or 12 months because you pay annually), you will continue to have all of the benefits available under those subscriptions until the end of the period for which you have paid.
For example, if you cancel your 12 month subscription during its second month, you can continue to use the benefits under the subscription for the remaining 10 months.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you were&amp;nbsp.
an existing Curve Black or Metal subscriber at the time version 1.2 of these Terms was published (29 April 2021), the minimum subscription periods detailed above will not apply to you for so long as you continue on your current subscription (this includes annual subscribers when their subscription renews).
If you upgrade from Black to Metal or downgrade from Metal to Black or change your subscription payment schedule from monthly to annually or annually to monthly, the minimum subscription periods will apply.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>More than one account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can not hold more than one Curve account.
We can close down additional accounts without informing you first.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Upgrading your account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can upgrade your account simply by clicking on the ‘Manage Your Subscription’ tab in the app.
You can also change the payment card your subscription is charged to using the same tab.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we can’t charge your nominated payment card for subscription fees or any other fees you owe us - e.g., if your card has expired or has insufficient funds - you agree that we can take them from any other payment card you’ve linked to your Curve account.
If we can’t take the fees from any of the other payment cards either, you’ll need to provide us with a valid payment card within 30 days of our request to do so, otherwise we may either close or downgrade your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Downgrading your account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can downgrade your account by getting in touch with us and fees may be payable in accordance with the Fee Schedule.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Curve reserves the right to restrict the ability to subscribe to the Curve Metal or Curve Black account for customers who upgrade or downgrade from another type of Account, more than once in a given 12 month period.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Fees.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can find details of the fees we charge in the Fee Schedule.
We will keep you informed before we introduce any new fee or make changes to any existing fees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Replacement Card.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>We charge fees for replacing your Curve card at the time we process the request for a replacement card.
We can charge the fee from any of the payment cards linked to your Curve account.
We won’t charge you to replace a card that has been stolen or misappropriated.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Curve Fronted<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Using your Curve card (with a debit or credit card as your payment card) to pay merchants who only accept payments by debit card, or who either impose a charge or deny certain types of credit cards (e.g.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>), is defined by Curve as a Curve Fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our Fees Schedule for details).
Please note that before you start using this function you should make sure that your underlying credit card issuer allows usage of your credit card to fund Curve card transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please remember that when you fund your Curve card with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to Curve Fronted transactions using Curve.
Curve will not be liable for such fees.
These fees are strictly non-refundable in nature,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>you may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges which are outside our control and not charged by us e.g.
your payment card issuer may charge you for making a payment through your Curve card.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Uses.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can use your Curve card to make payments online or at mPos or to withdraw cash.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Authorised transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> We’ll consider a transaction to be authorised by you when you do at least one of the following:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you use your Curve Card to make a withdrawal from an ATM or make a payment (for example, in a shop or restaurant), we will consider the payment to be authorised by you unless:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>you let us know that the money has been stolen from your account.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>you don't think we've carried out your instructions correctly.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We start to process your transaction at the time you use your card either for an ATM withdrawal, online transaction or payment at a terminal.
It’s important to note that the authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days and can be processed at any time during these 30 days.
If a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction.
You remain responsible under these Terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your Curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.
You also agree that if Curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by Curve to the merchant, Curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the Curve app.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Cancelling transactions.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can cancel a transaction you’ve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.
Just contact us to do this.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Changes to payment amounts.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it.
In these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change.
You agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall to&amp;nbsp.
you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Pre-authorisations.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>If you’ve used your card to pre-authorise a transaction of less than EUR 150 (or its equivalent in your local currency), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you can’t use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction.
If the final amount is less than EUR 150, we’ll refund or unblock the difference.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Continuous payment authority.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You can use your Curve card to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.
We’ll make the payment from the payment card you’ve selected in the Curve App at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment.
If you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Spending limits.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your Curve app.
We may change these limits every now and then.
You can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you have to wait 3 months to request another review.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.
When we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat.
We’ll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.
so please make sure you keep your account details up to date by contacting us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>What about foreign currency transactions?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In case of withdrawals or purchases using your Curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - Curve will perform a currency conversion for you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If, when making a transaction, you have set your payment&amp;nbsp.
card currency in the Curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.
This might be in addition to any fees that Curve charges you.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your Curve card we’ll use an exchange rate which will be either the:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Standard exchange rate.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day.
We’ll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in London, UK.
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Weekend exchange rate.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This is the rate at the time the markets are closed in London, U.K.
It will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.
We can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please check our Fee schedule to find out the currency conversion fee applicable for the currency exchange transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date it’s actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice.
The rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the Curve app.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you use the Go Back in Time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, it’s possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply.
If the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can contact us at support@curve.com for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.
You can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your Curve app.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ll not be responsible to you if you’re charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Who’s responsible for losses on your Curve card or account?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>When you’ll be responsible.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>You’re responsible for all losses where:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>you’ve acted fraudulently,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>you deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your Curve card and account security details safe.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you don’t tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your Curve card, you’ll have to pay up to EUR 50 (or its equivalent in your home currency) of the losses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>When we’ll be responsible.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We'll always try to process your payments correctly and on time, but sometimes things go wrong.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>If they do, <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>we’ll refund you any money you’ve lost as a result of:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>any unauthorised transaction which you’ve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided you’ve not acted fraudulently or carelessly,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>our mistakes, or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may also refund you where you’ve used your Curve card to make a payment in the European Economic Area (EEA) without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.
when hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Just drop us a line through the app or at support@curve.com as soon as you notice it but not later than&amp;nbsp.
13 months after the date of the transaction, and provide us with any further information we need to look into this.
We’ll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons for rejecting your request.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>What can I not use my Curve account and Curve card for?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We know most customers will but you must use your Curve account and card responsibly.
You can’t use them:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>for anything that’s against the law (e.g.
fraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or may harm our software, systems or hardware,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>in a way that your payment card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellers’ cheques from non-financial institutions,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>for “cash recycling”, which means using your Curve card to make an ATM withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your Curve card,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>to create one or more Curve account(s) without our permission attempt to “double dip” or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>to make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card e.g.
cash advances or transactions for investment purposes.
Check your payment card’s terms to see what’s allowed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In the event you owe Curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using Curve, or missed subscription fees, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards.
We reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to Curve by using any payments received to your Account.
We may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Go back in time<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain transactions after they were made.
Check out which <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>transactions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> this is possible for in the Curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).
Be aware your card issuer may charge a fee for this, which we’re not responsible for.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Curve Rewards<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish.
We call this Curve Rewards.
Our Curve Rewards Supplemental Terms are here.
The terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.
Provided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your Curve Cash card an amount in accordance with those offers.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The funds paid by us to your Curve Cash card for any Curve Rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by Lithuanian law.
These funds are available for you to spend when you select the Curve Cash card as a funding source for your Curve card.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please note that you cannot use your Curve Cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to Curve.
If you want to withdraw funds from your Curve Cash card, you can get in touch with us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Curve Cash<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using their Curve account and card – we call this Curve Cash.
You can check out the current Curve Cash Terms&amp;nbsp.
on our website.
We change this every now and then but you can keep a tab on this through our <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>website<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Curve Cash is different to Curve Rewards.
With Curve Cash, you’ll receive Curve Cash Points, which we add to your Curve Cash card.
However, Curve Cash Points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike Curve Rewards).
Your Curve Cash Points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.
You cannot use Curve Cash Points to pay for any fees due to Curve.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you use your Curve Cash card for a transaction, Curve will convert your Curve Cash Points to e-money (our little gift to you!) to the value of the transaction.
You will still be charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these Points are used.
If there are not enough Curve Cash Points on your Curve Cash card, the transaction will be declined.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please note that if your Curve Cash card holds Curve Cash Points in addition to other funds (for example, from Curve Rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your Curve Cash Points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Curve Cash Points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your Curve Cash card.
If your Account is closed either by you or by Curve, you will not be able to redeem the value of your Curve Cash Points.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can also access your accounts with other service providers and initiate payments from those accounts.
We call these Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Initiation Service (PIS).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you use our AIS to view information about an account you hold with another provider, or use our PIS to initiate a payment from an account you hold with another provider to initiate a transaction, you must authorise us to access that account and/ or make a payment.
We won’t store any of the sensitive payment data you provide to give that authorisation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We will consider that you gave us consent and authorised us to initiate payments or view information from those accounts when you choose in your Curve app the certain service and filled in requested information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Open Banking permissions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may provide you access through the Curve app to a third party AIS and PIS provider - to check whether this service is available in your country - please check <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>here<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
These services will allow you to obtain financial information from your online bank or third party payment account (account information services) and to make online payments directly from your third party payment account (payment initiation services).
You will need to sign up to the third party AIS and PIS provider’s terms and conditions during the sign up process and provide them your details in order to create an account on their system and to access your data or execute payments.
We have no responsibility for the products and services provided to you by or through the AIS and PIS third party provider and will not be liable to you for any harm, damage or loss arising from your use of the products and services provided to you by or through the third party AIS and PIS provider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The terms and conditions that are connected to your third party payment account apply to the payment accounts that you access through the third party AIS and PIS provider will remain in effect and are not amended by these terms and conditions.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Curve is not responsible for the information that you receive from the third party payment account provider or third party AIS and PIS provider.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ll give you at least 2 months’ notice if we want to close your account for any other reason, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>How can you close your account?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By accepting these Terms you agree that Curve will start implementing them before the end of the 14 days “cooling off” period.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can cancel your account at any time by emailing us at support@curve.com or contacting us in the app.
You’ll get a refund of any subscription fees you’ve paid if you change your mind within the first 14 days of signing up (the “cooling off” period).
You will be charged pro rata if you have used any of the Curve services (including receiving a card).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you’re a Curve Metal customer, you’ll need to give us 1 months’ notice before you can close your account.
If you cancel or downgrade your Curve Metal account in the first six months after subscription - you will also be charged a Curve Metal card fee to cover the cost of ordering and delivering the metal card.
If you cancel after the first six months have elapsed - this cost is on us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>On closing your account, you still need to pay us any fees you owe us or any transactions that have not yet completed.
You’ll also need to make sure you cancel any outgoing payments you don’t want to pay anymore.
If there is a balance on your Curve account, this will be redeemed to an underlying card’s bank account - once we complete our checks (if needed).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If any balance is still remaining on your account when your account is closed you can request to have these funds returned to a bank account in your name, subject to our checks.
You forfeit your rights on these funds if you do not claim these funds within 6 years from the date your account was closed.
During this period your funds will be kept safe.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Our liability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We are liable for proper execution of your payment transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we breach our Terms with you, we’ll only be responsible for losses that could have been foreseen at the time we entered into these Terms and are directly related to the event in question.
We’ll do all we reasonably can to make sure that our services are not interrupted and are accessible at a reasonable speed.
However, we can’t promise that this will always be the case e.g.
where we rely on third parties to process payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Nothing in these Terms will stop us being responsible to you, if we act fraudulently, we act with a very significant degree of carelessness, or we’re at fault and the law does not allow us to exclude or limit our liability.
We will not be liable to you in respect of any losses you or any third party may suffer in connection with the use of Curve’s service - app, account or Curve card as a result of our actions which were not a foreseeable consequence of our actions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you are living in another EEA country when this agreement starts, Lithuania law will still apply, but will not act to deprive you of any mandatory protections that would have been afforded to you in that country.
In addition, the competent authorities of that country will have jurisdiction to hear any claims in relation to this agreement, but you can still bring a claim against us in the competent authorities of Lithuania if you want to.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
