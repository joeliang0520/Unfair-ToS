<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please note that if you subscribe to a newsletter, the Publisher determines whether that newsletter will be free or subject to a subscription fee.
Revue does not set the fee for such subscriptions.
If you have a dispute regarding any payment you’ve made to the Publisher, you understand and agree that such dispute is between you and the Publisher directly.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
