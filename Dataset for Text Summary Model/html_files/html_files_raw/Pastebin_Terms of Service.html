<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>We use these basic terms throughout the Agreement, and they have specific meanings.
You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.
There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span> 1.

It also refers to Pastebin-owned subdomains of Pastebin.com <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> 4.
“The User,” “you,” and “your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service.

Account Terms <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>A human must create your account.
you must be 13 or over to create an account.
you must provide a valid email address.
and you may not have more than one free account.
You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while your account is being used.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.
Account Requirements<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> We have a few simple rules for accounts on the Pastebin Service.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> You must be a human to create an account.
Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
We do permit machine accounts.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions.
A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.
Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.
You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> One person or legal entity or organization may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> You must be age 13 or older.
Pastebin does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.
If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately.
If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older.
in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.
User Account Security<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> You are responsible for keeping your account secure.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password.
Pastebin cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> You will promptly notify Pastebin if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Pastebin, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose.

For avoidance of doubt, any permission we may grant will in all cases exclude the ability to publish, redistribute, or otherwise make any Content available to third parties (as distinguished from a cybersecurity, anti-counterfeiting, other similar product or tool you may develop using Content but that does not itself result in redistribution of the Content) unless you have permission to do so directly from the User who posted the Content.

Scraping<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler.
It does not refer to the collection of information through Pastebin's authorized <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>scraping API, which is available on a paid basis with a Pastebin PRO account<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
Scraping is strictly prohibited except in the following limited circumstances: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> Bona fide academic and other researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from the Website for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>▶<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> Archivists may scrape the Website for public data for archival purposes.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Without limiting the foregoing, you may not scrape Pastebin for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Pastebin users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>If you scrape our site too aggressively, even for permissible purposes, we may block your IP.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> To help prevent this from happening, we have created a scraping API tool (“Scraping API”).
We require a Pastebin PRO account to access the scraping API.
Even with a Pastebin PRO account, some limits may continue to exist per the term of the Pastebin PRO Account program.
For unlimited access to “public” Content on the Website (i.e., excluding Content the posting User has marked as private, unlisted or otherwise restricted, or which is expired), an Enterprise API Subscription is required.
If you are interested in getting a PRO account or Enterprise API Subscription, contact us at sales@pastebin.com.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> All use of Pastebin data gathered through scraping must comply with these Terms, the Pastebin Privacy Statement, and the terms of your Enterprise API License, if any.

Excessive Bandwidth Use<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>You own Content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the Content you post.
You still have control over Your Content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those set forth in these Terms.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create, upload or own ("Your Content").
If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post.

and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>5.
License Grant to Other Users<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.
However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Sections D.4 and D.5, but not otherwise.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> To the extent this Agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Pastebin the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service consistent with these Terms of Service.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>You may have access to private pastes.
We treat the content of private pastes as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security, antifraud, legal compliance, or other similar reasons.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>

Control of Private pastes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Some accounts, such as paid accounts, may have private pastes, which allow the User to control access to Content.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Pastebin considers the contents of private pastes to be confidential to you.
Pastebin will protect the contents of private pastes from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.
Please understand, however, that no security can guaranty against possible unauthorized disclosure or access, and no guarantee is made that private pastes may not become accessible to unauthorized third parties.

N.
Legal Disputes and Arbitration Agreement <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>You and we agree to resolve disputes on an individual basis via arbitration, with limited exceptions, unless you opt out as described below.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.
Initial Dispute Resolution<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> We are available by email at support@pastebin.com to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Website or Service.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>2.
Terms of Service and Binding Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the “Initial Dispute Resolution” paragraph above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.
All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Agreement (including its formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Website or Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS on a non-confidential basis in accordance with the provisions of its then-effective rules, including its streamlined procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service or the Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of the Agreement or these Terms of Service is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The procedures and rules of the Federal Arbitration Act shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision and the parties hereby reject, waive and disclaim the application of any state Arbitration Act, with all other issues determined under the internal laws of the State of Nevada applicable to contracts made and performed in that state wihtout regard to principles of conflicts of laws.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> The JAMS Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/, or by calling JAMS at 1.800.352.5267.
To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.
A request for payment of fees should be submitted to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and Pastebin will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000.
The arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>3.
Class Action Waiver<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>4.
Exception – Small Claims Court Claims <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>5.
Exception – Intellection Property, Confidenitiality and Privacy Protection<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in court per Section N.7 below to enjoin infringement or misuse of intellectual property, confidential information, or User Personal Information.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>6.
30 Day Right to Opt Out <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in the preceding three paragraphs by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: support@pastebin.com.
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of creating an account to use the Website or Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes as set forth herein.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>7.
Exclusive Venue for Litigation <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span> Solely to the extent the arbitration provisions set forth above do not apply, or for purposes of either party enforcing an award granted to it pursuant to arbitration, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Las Vegas, Nevada (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).
The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Las Vegas, Nevada for any litigation other than small claims court actions.
The parties irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction in Las Vegas , Nevada for any litigation and hereby waive, for all purposes, their right to challenge the lack of personal jurisdiction of Las Vegas , Nevada over any litigation arising in connection with, out of, or as a result of (a) these Terms of Service, the Agreement, the Website or the Service, and (b) any acts or omissions of Pastebin, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees or agents in connection with these Terms of Service, the Agreement, the Website or the Service, or any action to enjoin infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights, confidential informaiton or User Personal Information.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>8.
Timing of Claims <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
