These Terms cover all present and future features provided by your Account.
The Services are operated by Proton AG (“We”, the “Company”).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you agree to these Terms on behalf of a company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its affiliates, and all users who access the Services through your Account to these Terms.
In the absence of such an authority, you are not authorized to use the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Users of the Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Services are provided exclusively to individuals who are at least 13 years of age, </div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">or to minors who have obtained parental or legal guardian consent to open and maintain an Account</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Services are provided exclusively to persons.
Accounts registered by “bots” or automated methods are not authorized and will be terminated.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Each user is solely responsible for all actions performed through the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Authorized use of the Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree not to use the Services for any illegal or prohibited activities.
You also agree not to disrupt the Company’s networks and servers in your use of the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Spam, which is the practice of sending irrelevant or unsolicited messages or content over the internet, typically to a large number of recipients, notably for the purposes of advertising, phishing, or spreading malware or viruses, is prohibited.
Moreover, you agree not to use the Services to send junk mail, bulk emails, or mailing list emails that contain persons that have not specifically agreed to be included on that list.
You agree not to use the Services to store or share content that violates the law or the rights of a third party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Having multiple free accounts is not considered an acceptable use of our service (e.g.
bulk signups, a large number of free accounts created by a single organization or individual).
Abusive registrations of aliases for third-party services is also not acceptable.
Free accounts must also only be created and maintained by their effective users (e.g.
it is not acceptable to create accounts in anyone else’s name and later transfer credentials to that third party).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any Account found to be committing the above-mentioned activities will be immediately suspended.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Trading or selling a Proton Mail account to a third party is prohibited and the Company reserves the right to suspend infringing accounts.
This rule does not apply to our Lifetime Accounts, which can be sold or traded exclusively through the Company.
The Company has no obligation to store or forward the contents of terminated accounts.
We also have no obligation to store messages or contents for accounts that exceed their storage quotas.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Company reserves the right to terminate Accounts immediately if a fraudulent payment is detected, such as a payment with a stolen credit card.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Company may also terminate Accounts which are being used for illegal activities that are not listed in the present section, particularly in response to orders from the competent authorities informing of such illegal activity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Although it is not current practice, the Company reserves the right to suspend or delete free Accounts that have been inactive for a consecutive period of three months or more.
However, our current inactive Account policy is not as strict.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Limited warranties and liability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Company does not make any warranty about the reliability of the Services or guarantee the security of user data, despite best efforts.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Service level agreement (SLA)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>For users with Proton for Business Accounts, the Company aims to provide Service availability of 99.95% or better.
If downtime in any month exceeds 0.05% of that month, the Company will credit the user’s Account.
Service credits are applied at the user’s request and will apply toward the balance due at the end of the next billing cycle (either monthly or yearly).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> The Company calculates service credits in the following way:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span> If the monthly uptime is less than 99.95% but equal to or greater than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 10% of the Service’s monthly cost;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If the monthly uptime is less than 99.0%, the service credit is equal to 30% of the Service’s cost.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some performance issues are excluded from downtime calculations, such as:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Issues caused by factors outside of the Company’s reasonable control;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Issues that resulted from any actions or inaction by a user or a third party;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Issues that resulted from the user’s equipment and/or third-party equipment (not within the primary control of the Company).
For the avoidance of any doubt, the Company does not provide any internet or network services and any performance issues related to that type of services shall be deemed not in the primary control of the Company;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Issues that arise from the Company’s suspension or termination of rights to use the Service in accordance with the Terms;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
