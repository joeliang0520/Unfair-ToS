<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.8 If the user does not act in accordance with the provisions above, GOOSE will be entitled to impose instructions on the user.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.2 All rates referred to on the website are including VAT and any other duties or taxes imposed by authorities.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.3 If the agreement is converted into an agreement for an indefinite period the collection of the payment will take place by means of direct debit collection.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.4 The collection will take place prior to the provision of the service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.5 It is assumed for the recording of the amount of the collection that the user continues with his/her choice of package, unless the user has notified otherwise.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.6 GOOSE will in advance notify the date on which the direct debit collection will take place by means of an electronic message or an invoice.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.7 The user will be in default without further notice of default if the direct debit collection cannot take place.
GOOSE will forward a payment reminder to the user whereby the user will be provided with the opportunity to pay within 14 days.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.8 The user will owe default interest from the date of the default at the statutory interest rate applicable at that time.
The user will be obliged to pay any judicial and extrajudicial costs to GOOSE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.9 If GOOSE at any time has doubts regarding the user’s creditworthiness, GOOSE will have the right to demand specific security, such as a security deposit or bank guarantee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.10 The user must make objections against the amount of the collection apparent within 30 days.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Article 8 Force Majeure<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.1 If GOOSE, due to a non-attributable failure (force majeure) cannot fulfil its obligations, the fulfilment of these obligations will be suspended for the duration of the force majeure.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.2 A failure in the provision of service cannot be attributed to GOOSE if this cannot be blamed on fault on its part, or a cause for which GOOSE is not accountable by law, by legal act or according to generally accepted standards.
These circumstances also include, but are not limited to: power failures, war, environmental disasters, breakdowns of the internet connection, breakdowns in the telecommunication infrastructure, breakdowns of networks, failures on the part of engaged third parties, or suppliers, strike actions and business closures.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.3 In the event of force majeure the obligation on the part of GOOSE of fulfilment of the agreement will lapse.
In that event GOOSE will not owe any compensation.
GOOSE will be exclusively obliged for a consumer-user to provide refund of the subscription fee pro rata the duration of the breakdown, unless this cannot be required of it in all reasonableness, with due regard to the duration and the circumstances.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>8.4 If the force majeure lasts for more than four weeks, both parties will have the right to terminate the agreement wholly or in part, insofar as this is justified by the force majeure.
The user will not have the right to any compensation in the event of force majeure on the part of GOOSE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Article 9 Default and termination<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.1 In the event of default on the part of the user, or in one of the cases below under article 9.4 all GOOSE’s claims against the user, on whatsoever basis, will be immediately due and payable in full, and GOOSE will be entitled to suspend the provision of the service.
The above will not affect any of GOOSE’s other rights on the basis of the law or the agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.2 If the user is in default GOOSE will provide the service again if the user still fulfils the obligations within the period set out by GOOSE.
The user will owe the costs for this recommencing of the service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.3 GOOSE as well as the user can terminate the agreement if the other party does not properly fulfil one or more of the other party’s obligations on the basis of the agreement, insofar as this failure justifies the termination.
If fulfilment is still possible the agreement can only be terminated after the other party has been given demand in writing and the failure is not eliminated within the period stated thereby.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.4 In the event of (provisional) moratorium, bankruptcy, cessation, or liquidation of (the business of) the user, or if the user is or has become legally incompetent, is placed under a regime of administration, or in any other manner whatsoever loses the free disposition over his/her assets, the agreement will be terminated by operation of law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.1 Complaints regarding defects/breakdowns in the service must be reported to GOOSE electronically or by telephone as soon as possible after the discovery thereof.
The user will be obliged, after noticing any breakdown, to do, and to refrain from, anything that is reasonably possible for the prevention of damage.
The user will provide all cooperation necessary for the inspection and the solution of the compliant, inter alia by providing GOOSE with the opportunity to conduct an inspection of the circumstances of the use of the service and the factors related thereto.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.2 If the user makes a complaint regarding defects in the service correctly, justifiably and in a timely manner, GOOSE will make endeavours to resolve the defect as soon as possible.
GOOSE will state, if possible, when the defect has presumably been solved.
If the user does not make a compliant in a timely manner the user will loss his/her rights.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.3 The costs of the breakdown inspection and the costs for eliminating the breakdown will be at GOOSE’s expense.
If the breakdown is the result of an attributable failure on the part of the user, GOOSE can charge on these costs to the user.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>10.4 GOOSE will not be obliged to any payment (of compensation) if GOOSE has fulfilled the obligation included in this article.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.1 GOOSE will not be liable for any consequential loss, which the user or a third party might suffer due to the use of the service.
This also includes, but is not limited to: trading loss, lost profits, loss or theft of data, intangible loss, unauthorised access to confidential information.
Consequential loss is also loss or damage related to, or resulting from, interruptions or blocking of the access to GOOSE’s network, the internet of GOOSE or third parties, a defect in the security of the information stored by the user, acts on the part of other users, or other internet users, and lastly, changes in login procedures and account data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.2 In any event the contractual and legal liability on the part of GOOSE towards the user, non-consumer, will be at all times limited to the payments excluding VAT actually made by the user to GOOSE during the ongoing contract year, which will be with a maximum of EURO 100 per incident, whereby a related series of incidents will apply as one single incident.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.3 GOOSE will only be liable towards the user per incident to a maximum of the (annual) subscription owed by the user to GOOSE.
GOOSE will only be liable towards one and the same user per year to a maximum of twice the (annual) subscription owed by the user to GOOSE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.4 If several users are affected at the same time by damage caused by GOOSE, GOOSE will be liable in that case towards all users jointly up to a maximum amount of EURO 500.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>11.5 Damage must be reported as soon as possible to GOOSE in writing or electronically, but no later than within four weeks after the arising thereof.
Damage that has not been brought to the attention of GOOSE within this period will not be eligible for compensation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Article 12 Indemnification by the user<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The user indemnifies GOOSE against claims by third parties for compensation of damage, which these third parties could (attempt to) recover from GOOSE in any manner whatsoever, due to the fact that use has been made of GOOSE’s service, or as the case may be due to the user not having fulfilled the user’s obligations towards GOOSE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>13.2 Copying the documentation for normal personal use and backup purposes is permitted.
When making copies all references determining the ownership and origin must remain unaltered.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>14.1 The user will not be entitled to transfer rights and obligations under the agreement to a third party without permission in writing from GOOSE.
Conditions can be attached to this permission.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>14.2 GOOSE will be entitled to transfer its rights and obligations under the agreement to a third party, if this takes place in the context of the transfer of (a part of) the enterprise run by GOOSE.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
