A.
Definitions
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Observable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The “Website” refers to Observable’s website located at observablehq.com, and all content, services, and products provided by Observable at or through the Website.
It also refers to Observable-owned subdomains of observablehq.com, such as api.observablehq.com and ancillary websites, such as observableusercontent.com.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“The User,” “The Customer,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service.

Individual users must be at least 13 years of age.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“Observable,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Observable, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>An “Account” represents your legal relationship with Observable.
A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Observable.
A “Team Account” refers to an Account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group.
“Teams” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many notebooks at once.
A User Account can be a member of any number of Teams.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Short version:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>User and Team Accounts have different administrative controls.
A human must create your account.
You must be at least 13 years old.
You must provide a valid external identity.
You may not have more than one free account.
You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Account Controls
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Users.
All Users retain ultimate administrative control over their User Accounts and the Content within them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Teams.
Within the Service, the Team creator must designate one or more User Accounts as “owners” who are delegated ultimate administrative control of the Team.
The owners of each Team retain administrative control over the members of those Teams and all User-Generated Content posted to the notebooks within those Teams, subject to these Terms.
Team members can manage User access to the Team’s data and notebooks.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
2.
Required Information
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must log in with a valid email address — or a supported identity provider, such as GitHub, linked to a valid email address — in order to complete the signup process.
</div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">For User Accounts, any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.
Account Requirements
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You must create a User Account before you can create a Team Account.
We have a few simple rules for accounts on Observable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must be a human to create an account.
Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account.</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/li&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="1083" data-revision="latest" data-offset="4500">
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may not create an Account for the use of anyone under the age of 13.
While we are thrilled to see brilliant youngsters get excited by exploring data sets and visualizing algorithms, we must comply with United States law.
Observable does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.
If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately.
If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older.
In such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.
A paid Team Account may only provide access to as many User Accounts as it has paid for.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Overall, the number of Users accessing Team notebooks associated with your Team Account must not exceed the number we have authorized for your Team Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
4.

Observable cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You will promptly notify Observable if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, by sending an email to support@observablehq.com.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, and you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

If you have included private or sensitive information in your public notebook, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.
In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your private notebooks, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

How We Share the Information We Collect
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf.

We will respect your choices.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Tracking and analytics
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users’ use of Observable, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Observable Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections E.4 — E.6.
These license grants apply to Your Content.
If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Observable the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.
You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections E.4 — E.6.
The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
4.
License Grant to Us
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it.
You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.
This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups.
show it to you and other users you choose to show it to.
parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.
share it with other users you choose to share it with.
run it in a notebook environment.
and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.
We need these rights for both public and private notebooks because these rights are necessary for providing the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This license does not grant Observable the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
5.
License Grant to Other Users
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any User-Generated Content you or your Team Users post publicly may be viewed by others.
By publishing your notebooks, you agree to allow others to view, “import” and “fork” your notebooks.
This means that others may load your published Content into notebooks they control, or make their own copies of your published Content in notebooks they control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you publish a notebook, you grant each User of Observable a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Observable Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Observable as permitted through Observable’s functionality (for example, through forking).
If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Observable Users.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
6.
Contributions Under a Notebook License
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Whenever you make a suggestion to a notebook containing notice of a license, you license your suggestion under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your suggestion under those terms.
If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.
This style of collaboration is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community, where it’s commonly referred to by the shorthand “inbound=outbound”.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

We treat the content of private notebooks as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, to fix errors in the Service, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
1.
Control of Private Notebooks.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>User Accounts and Team Accounts may have private notebooks, which allow the User or Team to restrict access to Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
2.
Confidentiality of Private Notebooks.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Observable considers the contents of private notebooks to be confidential to you or your team.
Observable will protect the contents of private notebooks from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
3.
Access.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Observable employees may only access the content of your private notebooks in the following situations:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons.
If Observable accesses a private notebook for support reasons, we will ask for and obtain the notebook author’s permission first.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When access is required for maintenance reasons, to fix an error in the Service, or to upgrade notebooks for a new version of the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When access is required for security reasons, including to prevent abuse, and to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Observable’s systems and Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When access is required for analytics reasons, to learn how Observable users are making use of the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

4.
Exclusions.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private notebook are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose User Personal Information or the contents of your private notebooks in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, we strive for transparency.
