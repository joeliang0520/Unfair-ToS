<p> </p><div data-document-id="2654" data-revision="latest" data-offset="0"> About <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Totem is designed as an educational resource for communities learning
about digital security.
It is an initiative of Greenhost and Free Press
Unlimited.
The Totem platform provides a way for content contributors and
community users to continuously interact and exchange knowledge throughout
the learning process.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> The goals of the platform are <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To improve basic understanding of digital security and related tools for
journalists, activists and human rights defenders by creating a safe
online classroom environment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To build a safe MOOC based on existing open source software (Open edX)
that is co-developed with and usable for digital training organisations,
individual trainers and students.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To be sustainable through collaboration to ensure the availability of
the platform once the initial stage of the project is completed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Governance Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Totem is built on Open edX, an open source educational platform started by
edX, an initiative of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) together with the xConsortium.
Greenhost and Free
Press Unlimited provide Totem as an open source platform in order to
ensure the sustainability of this resource, welcoming contributors and
communities well beyond the start of the project.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Types of content <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Totem platform content is adapted, developed and produced in cooperation
with content partner organisations, digital security trainers, and
communities.
Totem hosts three kinds of content:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Original content developed for Totem by Greenhost and Free Press
Unlimited, which is available to all Totem users<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Content created by content contributors, which is also available to all
Totem users<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Community content created by course instructors, which is only
available to those participating in the course.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span> Content standards <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Original Totem content developed by Greenhost and Free Press Unlimited,
together with content partner organisations, is vetted by an advisory
board to ensure that it meets content standards or conforms to a set of
quality guidelines<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Community content is the responsibility of course instructors.
It can be
flagged by users of the platform who want to provide feedback or express
a concern over its quality<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Original and community content has a timestamp to indicate the date it
was last updated in order to help contextualise and verify the accuracy
of the materials presented.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Licensing <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>All content on Totem is licensed under a creative commons attribution
share-alike license.

contributors while also encouraging collaboration and avoiding the
duplication of existing resources.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> Totem content partners Content contributors and course instructors <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When creating new learning modules, community content contributors
choose how long the module should remain online.
Content can be
temporarily de-activated or set to never expire<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Community content contributors are expected to periodically review,
update or remove modules as they become outdated or outlive their use<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Community content contributors and course instructors can flag content
if they believe there to be an issue with its quality, however the
decision to remove material rests with Totem.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Community users Community users can: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>See and interact with materials produced by content contributors or
given access to by the content contributor and/or course instructor<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Flag or provide feedback on the curricula.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
