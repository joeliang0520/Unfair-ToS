<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
The Services include access to the 23andMe public Website and personal
genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided using the current
state of the art genetic research and technology available at the time of
providing the Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, 23andMe
is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for
its users.
You therefore acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of
the Services which 23andMe provides may change from time to time.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that 23andMe
may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features
within the Services) to you or to users generally at 23andMe's sole discretion.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You may stop using the Services at any time.
You do not need to specifically
inform 23andMe when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting
closure of your account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
23andMe assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms
of this TOS or other applicable terms.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly
or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees
associated with such access.
You are solely responsible for paying such fees.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet connection,
including a computer and modem or other access device.
You are solely responsible
for providing such equipment.
You acknowledge and agree that while 23andMe
may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions
you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage
space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be
set by 23andMe at any time, at 23andMe's discretion.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span> Important Issues Regarding 23andMe Services <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is permanent.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> </div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide
to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>
              <p> </p><div data-document-id="3071" data-revision="latest" data-offset="12453">
You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to
assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need
to obtain further services from 23andMe or from your physician or other health
care provider.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to
alter your life and worldview.
You may discover things about yourself that
trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g.,
your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your
ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average
chance of developing a specific condition or disease).
These outcomes could
have social, legal or economic implications.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the
laboratory process may result in errors.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> The laboratory may not be
able to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume
of DNA, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do
not meet our standards for accuracy.
If the initial processing fails for any
of these reasons, 23andMe will reprocess the same sample at no charge to you.&amp;nbsp.
If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andMe will offer to
send another kit to you to collect a second sample at no charge.
If you send another sample and 23andMe's attempts to process the
second sample are unsuccessful, 23andMe will not send additional sample
collection kits and you or the person who paid for the Service (if that is
not you) will be entitled to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andMe.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
In this event, you will not resubmit another sample through a future purchase
of the service.
If you breach these TOS and resubmit another sample through
a future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, 23andMe
will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide you or the person who paid
for the Service (if that is not you) a refund.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction
of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable
or incorrect (referred to as "Errors").&amp;nbsp.
As this possibility is known in advance,
users are not entitled to refunds or entitled to make any other claims where
these Errors occur.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
The above sets out our sole responsibility to you in the event that we are
unable to process your sample.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of
information from 23andMe.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Make sure to discuss your Genetic
Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act
upon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe Services.
For most common
diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction
of the risk.
There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle
choices that are far more important predictors.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
If your data indicates that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a
particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.
The opposite is also true.
if your data indicates you are at an elevated genetic
risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively
develop the disease or condition.
In either case, if you have concerns or
questions about what you learn through 23andMe, you should contact your
physician or other health care provider.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Genetic research is not comprehensive.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> While we measure many
hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage
of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.
The
research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important
mission of 23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
Please note that many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.
Because interpretations provided in the Services rely on these published
studies, some interpretations may not apply to you.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
Please further note that future scientific research may change the interpretation
of your DNA and the scientific community may show previous research to be
incomplete or inaccurate.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your
interests.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You should be careful about sharing your Genetic
Information with others.
Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies
request genetic information, but this could change in the future.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection
of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician
or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and
through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or
insurance companies in the future.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You acknowledge that Genetic Information that you share with family, friends
or employers may be used against your interests.
Even if you share Genetic
Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have
greater meaning in the future as technology improves and new discoveries are made.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
You should be aware that, if you are asked by an insurance company whether
you have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The Genetic Information provided by 23andMe is for&amp;nbsp;research,
informational, and educational use only.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This means two things.
First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically
validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the
research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing.
Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical
application of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users
to participate in 23andWe Research.
Participation in such research is voluntary
and based upon an IRB-approved consent document.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our
Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only.
The
Services are not intended to be used by you for any diagnostic purpose and are
not a substitute for professional medical advice.
You should always seek the
advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you
may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of
any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
23andMe does not endorse, promise or guarantee the effectiveness of any
specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
If we provide to you through our Service any information that identify for you,
based on your Genetic and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature
or research, concerns about your health, this information is intended for
informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
healthcare provider.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

We believe that:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
the state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly
evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture
of the role of genetics.
and
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess
your current state of health or disease, taking into account many
factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current
symptoms, if any.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

has with you after attempting to do so informally, we will discuss with you
and agree the most effective way of resolving our dispute using mediation or
arbitration based on the nature of our dispute.

prevent either of us from seeking injunctive (emergency) relief or other
equitable relief from the courts for matters relating to data security,
intellectual property or any other proprietary rights.

in the future.
