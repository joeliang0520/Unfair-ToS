("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>imgix<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>") govern your access to, use of, and participation in imgix's website, products, and services (collectively, the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>").

THE SERVICES <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Overview of Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> The Services may include imgix's web API, image processing, image analysis, image rendering, image caching, image routing, and image delivery.
The Services described under the “API Services” paragraph, do not involve image hosting or storage except for the limited caching described below.
However, the Services do provide certain hosted processing and rendering services (“Hosted Services”) as further described in the “Hosted Services” paragraph below.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>API Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> The Services imgix offers via its web API (“API Services”) enable you to control the actions imgix takes with respect to your images without uploading the images to the Services.
To use the API Services, you must connect your image hosting or storage location to the API Services.
You are responsible for updating your site or service's code to work with the API Services.
The API Services provide limited caching and rendering services that imgix uses during the course of providing the Services to you.
If an image cached via the API Services is removed from your storage or hosting location, it may remain on imgix's caching servers for a limited time.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Hosted Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> imgix may make certain Hosted Services available, which may enable users to upload images, use hosted processing features and functionality, and deliver or route such images.
You may use the Hosted Services only for Sandbox.
Without limiting the foregoing or any other terms of these Terms, you may not use the Hosted Services to serve image traffic other than for testing purposes.
Notwithstanding Section 12 (Change to the Services) below, imgix reserves the right to modify, discontinue or suspend access to the Hosted Services at any time for any reason, without notice or obligation to you.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Content Delivery.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> imgix can be accessed for content delivery of your User Content (as defined below).
When you access imgix for content delivery, imgix may cache your User Content for performance reasons.
When cached User Content is accessed, you will be charged only for bandwidth out of imgix.
Accessing User Content that has not been cached will trigger a render on imgix, which incurs additional charges.
Although imgix does not guarantee that any User Content will be cached, imgix will strive to cache your User Content for at least the lesser of (a) the amount of time you indicate you would like your User Content cached or (b) 30 days (the "<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Cache Period<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>").
imgix will not charge you to render User Content during the Cache Period, even if the User Content has been removed from cache.
imgix may cache User Content for longer than the Cache Period.
If you do not use imgix for content delivery, then imgix will not cache your User Content, and every request to access such User Content will incur rendering charges.
For purposes of the above, User Content hosted via the Hosted Services will be treated as though it has been cached by imgix.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>URL.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> imgix will provide you with a custom domain name that you may select for your imgix User Content (as defined below).
You will have the opportunity to select an alternative domain name at any time.
imgix does not guarantee the availability of any domain name.
imgix reserves the right to change your domain name with 14 days' advance notice to you.
If you do not change your domain name before the 14-day notice period expires, imgix will select an alternative domain name for you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 4.

MISCELLANEOUS <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Services.
