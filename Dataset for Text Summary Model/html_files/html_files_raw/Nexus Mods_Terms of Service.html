<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Nexus Mods strives to provide its users with services and information that facilitate the discussion and distribution of user-submitted video game modifications ("mods") and other video game related digital media.
To that end, this document establishes various acknowledgements, entitlements, and restrictions in regards to the usage of Nexus Mods websites, content, systems, and software.

Changes to Policies and Services
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We reserve the right to change this document, as well as our various policies and guidelines, at any time.
By continuing to use the service, you automatically agree to any revisions of these terms.
We encourage you to review these documents periodically at our Help Center.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Nexus Mods reserves the right to reconfigure its offerings and organisation and may choose to do so at any time.
This includes but is not limited to our services, website designs, membership pricing and offerings, advertising programs and partnerships, as well as staff related and/or administrative restructuring.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
General Usage of Websites and Services
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> By accessing Nexus Mods services, you hereby represent that you are aged 18 or older, or that you are aged 13 or older and do so with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> You will use Nexus Mods services reasonably and as intended.
You may not display, duplicate, dismantle, reverse engineer, circumvent, or repurpose any property or service owned or operated by Nexus Mods without consent.
You will not intentionally harm, disparage, or in any way disrupt the operation of Nexus Mods websites, systems, property, or staff.
You view and use all content at your own risk.
We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any content presented.
User-submitted content expresses the views of the author, not necessarily the views of any staff at Nexus Mods.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> In the interest of upholding our community standards when it comes to etiquette, we ask you to abstain from interacting with user-submitted content that you do not find to your liking, rather than engaging in active disparagement of content you disapprove of.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Fair Use Policy
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Attempting to download files or otherwise record data offered through our services (including but not limited to the Nexus Mods website and the Nexus Mods API) in a fashion that drastically exceeds the expected average, through the use of software automation or otherwise, is prohibited without expressed permission.
Users found in violation of this policy will have their account suspended.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Anti-Piracy Policy
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We have a strict anti-piracy policy and will take proactive action against anyone whose on-site activity gives us reasonable grounds to believe they are using pirated content such as, but not limited to, games and software.
Discussing, promoting or distributing such content on our sites will be met with administrative action.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
Accounts and User Identity
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> In order to access certain Nexus Mods services, you must create and utilise a singular account (i.e.
one account per person) consisting of a username, email address, and password.
Households or facilities from which multiple users (and therefore accounts) may access the sites and services are encouraged to inform staff to ensure that there are no potential misunderstandings in the case of moderation review.
More information can be found in our Moderation Policy.
Users who create multiple accounts may have any or all of those accounts terminated with other measures being taken to prevent such abuse as appropriate.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> It is your responsibility to ensure the email address attached to your account is up-to-date.
In the event of you losing access to your account, your email address is the only method that can be used to reclaim your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> When creating an account on our services, the username you choose must be appropriate for all audiences (i.e.
be free of profanity).
Accounts registered with inappropriate usernames will be subject to an immediate ban.
It is important that you keep your account information secure.
Nexus Mods is not responsible for any unauthorised use of your account.
It is the sole responsibility of the user to keep these records up to date and your failure to do so may lead to you losing access to your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> We encourage you not to disclose any personally identifying information on our services.
For more information about how we use information associated with your account, please refer to our Privacy Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> By creating an account, you understand and agree that access to these services may be restricted at our discretion.
These restrictions may be imposed by but are not limited to, membership status such as Supporter or Premium memberships, administration as described in our Moderation Policy, as well as our content/user blocking systems.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Avatar and signature images shall comply with the site rules.
If you are using links in your signature or on your profile page, please make sure that content featured on the linked website or webpage conforms to our requirements.
Ensure that any animated images you would like to use as your avatar do not contain excessively involved animations that can be construed as overly distracting.
We reserve the right to remove animated avatars at our sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> Users are able to permanently delete their account using the feature found on the ‘Security’ section of your account settings.
More information on the deletion process, deleted data, and best practices can be found in our Account Deletion Guidelines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
