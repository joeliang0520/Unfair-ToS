<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>It is our policy to suspend access to any Content you post on OnlyFans which we become aware may not comply with the Terms of Service (including, in particular, our Acceptable Use Policy) and/or any applicable law whilst we investigate the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of such Content.
If we suspend access to any of your Content, you may request a review of our decision to suspend access to the relevant Content by contacting us at support@onlyfans.com.
Following our investigation of the suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of the relevant Content, we may take any action we consider appropriate, including to reinstate access to the Content or to permanently remove or disable access to the relevant Content without needing to obtain any consent from you and without giving you prior notice.
You agree that you will at your own cost promptly provide to us all reasonable assistance (including by providing us with copies of any information which we request) in our investigation.
We will not be responsible for any loss suffered by you arising from the suspension of access to your Content or any other steps which we take in good faith to investigate any suspected non-compliance or unlawfulness of your Content under this section.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If we suspend access to or delete any of your Content, we will notify you via email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account, but we are not obligated to give you prior notice of such removal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right in our sole discretion to terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans for any reason by giving you 30 days’ notice by email or electronic message to your OnlyFans account.
We can also suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans immediately and without prior notice:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service (including in particular our Acceptable Use Policy), or if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we suspend access to your User account or terminate your agreement with us and your access to OnlyFans we will let you know.
During any period when access to your User account is suspended, any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension will be suspended, and we may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out in accordance with section 13 of the Terms of Use for Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Upon termination of your account, we may deal with your Content in any appropriate manner in accordance with our Privacy Policy (including by deleting it) and you will no longer be entitled to access your Content.
There is no technical facility on OnlyFans for you to be able to access your Content following termination of your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We can investigate any suspected or alleged misuse, abuse, or unlawful use of OnlyFans and cooperate with law enforcement agencies in such investigation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We can disclose any information or records in our possession or control about your use of OnlyFans to law enforcement agencies in connection with any law enforcement investigation of any suspected or alleged illegal activity, or in response to a court order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We do not authorize or approve Content on OnlyFans, and views expressed by Creators or Fans on OnlyFans do not necessarily represent our views.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We do not grant you any rights in relation to Content.
Any such rights may only be granted to you by Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your Content may be viewed by individuals that recognise your identity.
We will not in any way be responsible to you if you are identified from your Content.
While we may, from time to time and in our sole discretion, offer certain geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans, you understand and agree that we do not guarantee the accuracy or effectiveness of such technology, and you will have no claim against us arising from your use of or reliance upon any geofencing or geolocation technology on OnlyFans.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All Content is created, selected and provided by Users and not by us.
We are not responsible for reviewing or moderating Content, and we do not select or modify the Content that is stored or transmitted via OnlyFans.
We are under no obligation to monitor Content or to detect breaches of the Terms of Service (including the Acceptable Use Policy).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree that you have no obligation to follow any suggestions, comments, reviews or instructions received from another User of OnlyFans and that if you choose to do so, you do so entirely at your own risk.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We make no promises or guarantees of any kind that Creators or Referring Users will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans (including the OnlyFans Referral Program).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The materials which we make accessible on OnlyFans for Users are for general information only.
We make no promises or guarantees about the accuracy or otherwise of such materials, or that Users will achieve any particular result or outcome from using such materials.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We do not promise that OnlyFans is compatible with all devices and operating systems.
You are responsible for configuring your information technology, device, and computer programs to access OnlyFans.
You should use your own virus protection software.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We are not responsible for the availability of the internet, or any errors in your connections, device or other equipment, or software that may occur in relation to your use of OnlyFans.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>While we try to make sure that OnlyFans is secure and free from bugs and viruses, we cannot promise that it will be and have no control over the Content that is supplied by Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised User accounts, passwords, email accounts, or any resulting unauthorized activities or resulting unauthorized payments or withdrawals of funds.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You acknowledge that once your Content is posted on OnlyFans, we cannot control and will not be responsible to you for the use which other Users or third parties make of such Content.
You can delete your account at any time, but you acknowledge that deleting your account will not of itself prevent the circulation of any of your Content which may have been recorded by other Users in breach of the Terms of Service or by third parties prior to the deletion of your account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You confirm that you own all intellectual property rights (examples of which are copyright and trademarks) in your Content or that you have obtained all necessary rights to your Content which are required to grant licenses in respect of your Content to us and to other Users.
This includes any rights required to engage in the acts covered by sub-section 10(b) below in any territory in which OnlyFans is accessible and, in particular, in the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree to grant us a license under all your Content to perform any act restricted by any intellectual property right (including copyright) in such Content, for any purpose reasonably related to the provision and operation of OnlyFans.
Such acts include to reproduce, make available and communicate to the public, display, perform, distribute, translate, and create adaptations or derivative works of your Content, and otherwise deal in your Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The license which you grant to us under sub-section 10(b) above is perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable and transferable by us.
This means that the license will continue even after your agreement with us ends and you stop using OnlyFans, that we do not have to pay you for the license, and that we can grant a sub-license of your Content to someone else or assign or transfer the license to someone else.
This license will allow us, for example, to add stickers, text, and watermarks to your Content, to make your Content available to other Users of OnlyFans, as well as to use your Content for other normal operations of OnlyFans.
We will never sell your Content to other platforms, though we may sell or transfer any license you grant to us in the Terms of Service in the event of a sale of our company or its assets to a third party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Whilst we do not own your Content, you grant us the limited right to submit notifications of infringement (including of copyright or trademark) on your behalf to any third-party website or service that hosts or is otherwise dealing in infringing copies of your Content without your permission.
Although we are not under any obligation to do so, we may at any time submit or withdraw any such notification to any third-party website or service where we consider it appropriate to do so.
However, we do not and are under no obligation to police infringements of your Content.
You agree that if we request, you will provide us with all consents and other information which we reasonably need to submit notifications of infringement on your behalf.
Please see our Complaints Policy for how to make a complaint about infringement of intellectual property rights.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You waive any moral rights which you may have under any applicable law to object to derogatory treatment of any Content posted by you on OnlyFans.
This waiver does not affect in any way your ownership of any intellectual property rights in your Content or the rights which you have to prevent your Content from being copied without your permission.
The waiver is intended to allow us when dealing with your Content (as permitted by the license which you give us in section 10(b) above) to add watermarks, stickers or text to your Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Twitter:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Users have the facility to connect an active Twitter account to their OnlyFans account and to share certain Content in the form of OnlyFans posts to Twitter using the share feature.
If you use this feature, you must fully comply with Twitter's terms of service from time to time in respect of any Content shared in this way.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you are a Creator, when promoting your Creator account you must comply with our Terms of Service and the terms of service of any other website where you place a link to or otherwise promote your Creator account.
When promoting your Creator account, you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your Creator account is being promoted by us if this is not the case.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you are both a Fan and a Creator then your account will be deleted in two stages (Fan first and then Creator).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Subscriptions and purchases by Fans:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This section describes the terms which apply to transactions and interactions between Fans and Creators: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All transactions and interactions facilitated by OnlyFans are contracts between Fans and Creators on the terms of the Standard Contract between Fan and Creator.
Although we facilitate transactions and interactions between Fans and Creators by providing the OnlyFans platform, storing Content, and acting as a payment intermediary, we are not a party to the Standard Contract between Fan and Creator or any other contract which may exist between a Fan and Creator, and are not responsible for any transactions or interactions between Fans and Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Creators are solely responsible for determining (within the parameters for pricing on OnlyFans) the pricing applicable to transactions and interactions and the Content to which you may be given access.
All prices appear in USD only.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Fan Payments are exclusive of VAT, which shall be added at the current rate as applicable to Fan Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To view a Creator's Content and/or utilise the fan interaction function on OnlyFans, you must first add a payment card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Creator's profile.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You authorize us to supply your payment card details to a third-party payment provider for the purpose of processing your Fan Payment.
All Fan Payments will be charged in USD.
Your payment card provider may charge you currency conversion fees.
We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your payment card provider or bank and we are not responsible for paying any charges or fees imposed by your payment card provider or bank.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you choose to provide details of two or more payment cards, then if you try to make a Fan Payment from the first card and the card is rejected for any reason, then the other payment card will be used to collect the full Fan Payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The payment provider will take (i) monthly payments from your payment card for Fan Payments which are Subscriptions.
and (ii) immediate payments from your payment card for ad hoc Fan Payments such as use of the fan interaction function on a Creator's account or paying a tip to the Creator.
You authorize and consent to each of these payments being debited using your supplied payment card details.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to a Creator's profile will automatically renew at the end of the monthly subscription period, except if your payment card was declined, the subscription price has increased, or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.
This means that if you want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying continuing monthly subscription charges, you will need to turn off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's profile.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you cancel a Subscription you will continue to be permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content until the end of the subscription period in which you cancelled, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's profile, and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Creator's Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for a refund from any Creator which you follow, or unjustified chargeback requests of your payment card provider in relation to any transaction between you and a Creator.
If we consider that any request for a refund or chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have the right to suspend or delete your User account.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Wallet credits: You can prepay an amount to us (known as "Wallet Credits") which you can later use to make Fan Payments.
Purchases on OnlyFans cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount for that purchase.
Wallet Credits are subject to a maximum amount as determined by us from time to time.
Interest will not accrue on Wallet Credits.
You are entitled upon request (whether before or after the termination of your agreement with us) to a refund of unused Wallet Credits, unless we reasonably determine that your request for a refund is not made in good faith.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Suspension of your User account:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> If we suspend your User account in accordance with our rights under the Terms of Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have fallen due during the period of suspension of your User account will be suspended during the period of the suspension of your User account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree that we will only pay out Creator Earnings to the account of the Creator to which the Co-Authored Content is uploaded.
The Creator who uploaded the Co-Authored Content is solely responsible for dividing and distributing any revenue generated from the Co-Authored Content between the Creators shown in such Co-Authored Content.
Any such revenue-sharing agreement shall be an independent, private agreement between Creators, and we are not responsible for providing or enforcing any such agreements.
You understand and agree that you are not entitled to any Creator Earnings earned on any Co-Authored Content in which you appear but which is posted on another Creator’s account.
If you post Co-Authored Content on your account, we may require you to provide valid and complete legal information for all individuals which appear in the Co-Authored Content.
If you fail to provide any information requested by us upon our request, we may delete the Co-Authored Content, restrict your rights and permissions to post as a Creator, terminate your account, and/or withhold all or any portion of Creator Earnings earned but not yet paid out to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All Fan Payments will be received by a third-party payment provider approved by us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you have chosen the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Stripe<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Payout Option, we will ensure that Stripe, acting as our payment provider, will collect the Fan Payment and:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>pay Our Fee on the Fan Payment to an account held in our name.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>pay the Creator Earnings to your bank account or the bank account of a corporate entity in which you are a Person with Majority Control (see section 8 above).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Where Stripe is not the Payout Option chosen by you, we will receive the Fan Payment in full from the relevant payment provider.
We will deduct Our Fee from the Fan Payment and then will hold the Creator Earnings on your behalf in our capacity as your agent.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your OnlyFans account will be updated within a reasonable time with your Creator Earnings.
Your Creator Earnings will become available for withdrawal by you from your OnlyFans account once such Creator Earnings appear in your OnlyFans account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>To make a withdrawal of Creator Earnings from your OnlyFans account, you must have at least the minimum payout amount in your OnlyFans account.
Please click on the Banking page on your account to see what the minimum payout amount is for your country of residence and Payout Option.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The amount that you see in your ‘current balance’ in your OnlyFans account is your Creator Earnings at the relevant time.
All Fan Payments and Creator Earnings are transacted in USD only.
If you have chosen the “Stripe” Payout Option then the Fan Payments and Creator Earnings figures will be reflected in your local currency, at an exchange rate controlled by Stripe.
Your bank may charge you currency conversion or transfer fees to receive the money.
Additionally, your e-wallet company may charge you a fee for accessing the money.
We do not have control over currency exchange rates or charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company, and we are not responsible for paying any charges imposed by your bank or your e-wallet company.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If a Fan successfully seeks a refund or chargeback from their credit card provider in respect of a Fan Payment, we may investigate and may decide to deduct from your account an amount equal to the Creator Earnings earned by you on the charged-back or refunded amount.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Except for Payout Options involving payment by direct bank transfer from us, we do not store any data disclosed by you when you register your Payout Options with a third-party payment provider.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may withhold all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid out:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which we think has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User).
or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if we suspect that all or any part of the Creator Earnings result from unlawful activity, either by you or by the Fan who made the Fan Payment resulting in the Creator Earnings,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable).
If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service.
(ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) the Creator Earnings result from unlawful activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited your Creator Earnings.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any of your Creator Earnings where we have a right to do so under these Terms of Use for Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If we are withholding all or any part of the Creator Earnings due to you and we determine that part of the Creator Earnings withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity, then we may pay to you the part of the Creator Earnings which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity.
However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all Creator Earnings due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If once we have finished our investigation we determine that Creator Earnings are forfeited, we will use our best efforts to return any Fan Payments which resulted in forfeited Creator Earnings to the relevant Fans who paid such Fan Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We recommend that all Creators seek professional advice to ensure you are compliant with your local Tax and VAT rules, based on your individual circumstances.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

If, at any point whilst you have an OnlyFans account, any Tax non-compliance occurs in relation to you (including a failure by you to report earnings or the imposition on you of any penalty or interest relating to Tax) or if any litigation, enquiry, or investigation is commenced against you that is in connection with, or which may lead to, any occurrence of Tax non-compliance, you agree that you will:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>notify us by email to vat@onlyfans.com in writing within 7 days of the occurrence of the Tax non-compliance or the commencement of the litigation, enquiry or investigation (as applicable).

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>For the purposes of UK VAT only, Creators are treated as providing their services to OnlyFans, rather than to Fans directly.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you are a Creator registered for UK VAT:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You will be treated, for VAT purposes, as charging OnlyFans your Creator Earnings (80% of all and any Fan Payments), together with UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the Fan Payment;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>OnlyFans also agrees that, subject to the terms set out in this section of these Terms of Use for Creators, you can add UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the referral payment to the amount of any referral payments payable to you under the Referral Program Terms ("<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Referral Payments<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>").<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree to use the OnlyFans VAT invoice generator tool which can be found at: https://onlyfans.com/my/banking/vat/create-document to generate monthly VAT invoices, addressed to Fenix International Limited, in respect of your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) for the relevant period together with the VAT on such Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any);<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The VAT element added to your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if any) (the "VAT Amount") will be paid to you by us by way of a separate payment outside of your regular Creator Earnings, provided that you must have submitted to us copies of the following before payment of the VAT Amount will be made by us:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>More information on who is required to register for VAT in the UK, and the VAT position for Creators whose earnings are not above the earnings threshold or who are not VAT registered can be found at https://onlyfans.com/help/3/120 and in the following guidance from HM Revenue &amp;amp.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree that you will keep copies of all VAT invoices and VAT returns in connection with your earnings from OnlyFans and you will provide us with copies of such documents within 14 days of our written request that you do so.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is your obligation to comply with all provisions of VAT legislation and make, give, obtain, maintain and keep accurate, complete and up-to-date records, invoices, accounts and other documents required for the purposes of the VAT legislation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you are a Creator in the UK who is not required to register for UK VAT, then you should monitor the level of taxable sales that you make in the UK (including any Referral Payments) to ensure you have not exceeded the VAT registration threshold in the UK.
It is your obligation, as a taxable person, to monitor whether you have exceeded the VAT registration threshold.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We do not monitor earnings that Creators receive from other income sources.
However, we will monitor the annual earnings of UK Creators on our platform, and if you are not already VAT registered and your earnings exceed the VAT registration threshold, you will receive a notification from us asking you to register for VAT.
If you receive such a VAT registration notification, you agree to register for VAT as soon as possible and to send your VAT registration number to us at vat@onlyfans.com, within 6 weeks of such notification.
Failure to do so may result in your OnlyFans account being closed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>What is the OnlyFans Referral Program?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> OnlyFans offers a referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in becoming Creators to OnlyFans and receive referral payments from OnlyFans which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> The OnlyFans Referral Program is operated by Fenix International Limited.
We are a limited company registered in England and Wales, with company registration number 10354575 and we have our registered office address at Fourth Floor, Imperial House, 8 Kean Street, London, WC2B 4AS.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Only Users of OnlyFans with a current User account can participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.
If a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You will need on your User account page to add bank account details of your own bank account in order to receive referral payments under the OnlyFans Referral Program.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User may share with others.
When sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us.
You must not use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link.
Upon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your OnlyFans account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link and then register with OnlyFans using the same browser that they used to click on your unique referral link.
If someone registers with OnlyFans other than by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral and we will not make any referral payment to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with OnlyFans (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link.
If the Referred Creator is currently or has previously been a User of OnlyFans we will not make any referral payment to you for the referral.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account we will make referral payments to you on the earnings made by the Referred Creator from their first User account only.
We will not pay any referral payments to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred Creator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We will not pay any referral payments to you on any referral of a Referred Creator which we determine is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you.
You will provide any information which we request to enable us to determine whether the Referred Creator is owned or operated by you or if there is a commercial relationship between you and the Referred Creator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that when promoting OnlyFans in any way as a Referring User:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you will not give a false impression of OnlyFans, the services, programs, and content (including Content) made available through OnlyFans, its Users or the Terms of Service.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Creator that the potential Creator will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans, or any statements regarding the likely number of Fans.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Referral payments:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>How are referral payments calculated?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Once a Referred Creator has become a registered User of OnlyFans in accordance with the rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program described above, we will pay the Referring User a referral payment equal to five per cent.
(5%) of Fan Payments generated by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, up to a maximum referral payment by OnlyFans to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of US$1 million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at US$50,000 in total.
However, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent.
(5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, we will make referral payments to the relevant Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out by us to the Referring User on the referral, whichever occurs first.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>VAT:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> If you are a Referring User you should know that all referral payments payable to you by us will be inclusive of any VAT (as defined in the Terms of Use for Creators) which is or becomes chargeable on any supplies made by you, except as provided for in the "Promoting Tax compliance and VAT" section of the Terms of Use for Creators.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Warning:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading Scheme Regulations 1997 (as amended) and section 120(1) of the Fair Trading Act 1973, please read the warning below in respect of the OnlyFans Referral Program:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> In order to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by OnlyFans in your country of residence.
These methods are called "Payout Options".<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>How frequently are referral payments made?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We will transfer to your OnlyFans account the referral payment due to you on Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month on or around the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Who bears the cost of the referral payment?<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> The cost of the referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred Creator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment should be made.
Failure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We may change any aspect of the OnlyFans Referral Program (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the OnlyFans Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User of referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators before the changes came into effect.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User).
or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was made which resulted in the referral payment,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span> for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable).
If following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service.
(ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the OnlyFans Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity, then we may pay to you the part of the referral payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity.
However, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
