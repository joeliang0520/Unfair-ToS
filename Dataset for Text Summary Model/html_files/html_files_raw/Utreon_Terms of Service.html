Applicable Law and Venue<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(i) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Utreon agree that if you are a Subscribing Organization or a consumer resident of a jurisdiction other than those in (ii) below, the following governing law and arbitration provision applies:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH UTREON AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM UTREON.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You and Utreon agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Service or your use of the Utreon Services, except that you and Utreon are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.
ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
You and Utreon agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises.
Notice to Utreon shall be sent to Utreon Inc., Attn: Legal, 477 Madison Avenue, 6th floor, PMB# 4859, New York, NY, 10022.
You and Utreon further agree: to attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.
that any arbitration will occur in New York County, New York.
that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS.
and that the state or federal courts in New York County, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.
Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of New York and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.
Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Utreon will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(ii) If you are a resident in any jurisdiction in which the provision in the section above is found to be unenforceable, then the following shall apply:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service will be governed by and construed under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Any disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by competent civil courts within your jurisdiction of residence.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>e.&amp;nbsp.
Claims<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>YOU AND UTREON AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE UTREON SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 16.
Miscellaneous <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
Waiver<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we fail to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service, it will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by the relevant party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
Severability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If any provision of these Terms of Service or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from these Terms of Service to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
Assignment<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms of Service and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Utreon without restriction.
Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Terms of Service shall be void.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>d.
Survival<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>e.
Entire Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Terms of Service, together with the Terms of Sale, the Privacy Policy and the Guidelines, is the entire agreement between you and Utreon relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed or otherwise agreed to by both parties, or by a change to these Terms of Service or Guidelines made by Utreon as set forth in Section 6 above.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 17.
