Introduction
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Thank you for using OpenStreetMap.
These terms cover your use of services officially operated and provided by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).
In particular these are:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the openstreetmap.org website and associated services and APIs,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the OpenStreetMap data distribution,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the OpenStreetMap wiki and help websites,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the OpenStreetMap mailing lists and forums.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(together, the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>“Services”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By using these Services, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>"Terms"'<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>).
Please read them carefully.
If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please be aware of the following:

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>OSMF as host:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span> OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project.
A volunteer group operates the infrastructure and websites (many of which are collaborative Open Source projects), but the map data, wiki, mailing lists, and forums are contributed by users.
While one of the goals of the OpenStreetMap project is an accurate open data map of the world, OpenStreetMap Foundation does not and cannot proactively review all edits or other contributions.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span></div> <p></p>
              <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight user-annotations"> <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">Because our Services are used by people all over the world, personal information that we collect may be stored and processed in any other country in which we or our agents maintain facilities.</hypothesis-highlight></hypothesis-highlight>

The account must not contain any personal data about you, and you must not add any personal data about yourself.
For example, your parent may create an account using your parent’s email address and a username that is not associated with you, which your parent may permit you to use to contribute map edits.
For your protection, you are not allowed to use the social aspects of the Services (diary posts, ‘home’ location, mailing lists and forums), but you may contribute edits to the map.
You should not reveal any personal data in any communications you have regarding your map edits.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By registering as a user or providing personal information on the Services, you represent that you are at least 16 years old.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
Additional limitations on use of personal data:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Through your OSM account, you may have access to some personal data from other OSM contributors.
You may not use, store, or process any personal data available through the Services for any purpose other than:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you are a natural person, in the course of a purely personal or household activity<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by you or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Any other purpose authorised by the General Data Privacy Regulation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>For the avoidance of doubt, you may not use personal data available through the Services to:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Attempt to re-identify any natural person<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Attempt to stalk or harass any natural person<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Seek personal data from any minor without the express consent of their parent or legal guardian<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To fulfill the goal of distributing data that is truly open, untethered by rights of third parties and of high quality, we do not support anonymous contributions and retain additional, non-geographic, data on a legitimate interest base (see GDPR article 6.1f).
Common legitimate interests for which OSMF and OSM data users often process personal data include map editing and data integrity efforts that involve:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>identifying all the contributions made by an account,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>contacting the contributor in the case of questions in respect to the nature and source of the contributions,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>detection, removal and correction of spam accounts, vandalism and violations of the rights of third parties,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>facilitating communication between OpenStreetMap contributors.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>research and analysis on aggregate contributions to improve or prioritise OSMF services, such as evaluating mapping *efficacy, map completeness, determining if locations or mappers are disproportionately represented.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please see OSMF’s Privacy Policy for more information.

V.
End users and notification

In such circumstances, however, you may not be able to access your account or settings.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Even after your use and participation are banned, blocked or otherwise suspended, these Terms of Use will remain in effect with respect to relevant provisions, including Sections I-X.
