              <p> </p><div data-document-id="14777" data-revision="latest" data-offset="202">Introduction<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Terms of Service are long, legalistic documents.
Here are some important highlights from Neeva’s Terms of Service below:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Please don’t abuse our Services.
We may cancel your account if you do so.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Our Free Basic Tier Services are currently free to use.
We also offer, for a fee, Premium Tier Services which include a range of additional benefits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Only upload data that you have rights to.
We will use that data only in connection with our products or services or as directed by you.
For example, we might make copies and/or move the data around to provide services to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A search engine can be used for a lot of purposes: we are going to try every single time to show you great results (and never ads, or affiliate links), but we can’t guarantee the quality of the results you get.
We suggest that you consult experts regarding important topics involving your health, money, legal matters, etc.
We are not your doctor, financial advisor, or lawyer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your data is yours.
We won’t sell your data or show ads on the Services.
Lawsuits are expensive.
To save you and us money, you are agreeing to settle disputes by arbitration.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Please read our privacy policy.
It provides important details about what data we collect, how we use that data, and with whom we share that data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ve also included a “plain English” summary before each section of the Terms.
While this Introduction section and those summaries aren’t part of the Terms, we hope they’ll help you understand this important document.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Terms of Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please read these Terms of Service (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) and our Privacy Policy (https://neeva.com/privacy) (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Privacy Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at https://neeva.com (the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Site<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”) and the proprietary software platform, including any associated mobile applications we may make available (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>App<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”), web interfaces and browser extensions offered by Neeva, Inc.
(“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Neeva<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>our<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>we<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”, “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>us<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>”).
To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our web interfaces and browser extension and App are collectively called the “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S.
CUSTOMERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING, (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION), TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND NEEVA THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.
PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION ‎17 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 1<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> informs you that by signing up for an account, you – or your company – are agreeing to these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>

If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services and create a Neeva account.
If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company, (such as your employer), or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms.
In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that entity.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 2<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> asks you to read our Privacy Policy and lets you know that it’s part of these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 3<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> informs you that Neeva may change these Terms or the Services from time to time.
If we change the Terms, you’ll find the new Terms on the Site or we’ll notify you in another way.
By using the Services after we change the Terms, you’re agreeing to the new Terms.
If we change the Services in a significant way that negatively affects your use of the Services, we’ll let you know.
It’s your responsibility to export your data if you need it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>3.
Changes to these Terms or the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may update the Terms or the Service from time to time in our sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Services anymore.
Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>(b)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Updates to the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> We are constantly developing new technologies to improve our Services.
As part of this continual innovation, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, and increase or decrease limits to our services.
If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of the Services, or if we stop offering all or a portion of the Services, we will provide you with reasonable advance notice.
You are responsible for exporting your User Data from the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 5<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> says that if you give us Feedback (thanks!) we can freely use it.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>5.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 6<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> makes clear that we’re not charging for the Free Basic Tier Services as of today, and the fees for the Premium Tier Services are listed separately.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

Services Types and Fees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Neeva currently offers two tiers of Services: Free Basic Tier Services and Premium Tier Services.
Both Free Basic Tier Services and Premium Tier Services are referred to in these Terms as the Services.
Free Basic Tier Services are currently offered by Neeva free of charge.
Premium Tier Services, which include a range of additional benefits, are available for a fee.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Let’s break down <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 7<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> a bit.
Section 7(a) says that we don’t own the materials you make available (which we call User Data).
Under Section 7(b) you give us the right to use your User Data to provide our products or services and as you otherwise request.
Under Section 7(c) you confirm that you own the User Data or at least have the rights you need to give us the rights we need.
Section 7(d) states that you may delete your User Data from the Services but there’s a possibility it won’t be completely deleted, and when we stop providing the Services to you, we’ll delete all your User Data – so if you need it, you should back it up.
Finally, Section 7(e) makes clear that Neeva and our licensors are retaining all rights in what we make available to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Removal of User Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> You can remove your User Data by specifically deleting it.
You should know that in certain instances, some of your User Data may not be completely removed, and copies of your User Data may continue to exist on the Services.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Data.
Upon the earlier of termination or expiration of the Services or these Terms, we will promptly delete your data.
You are responsible for backing up your User Data and ensuring you have a copy of any User Data you need before these Terms or Services expires or is terminated.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Neeva and Third Parties’ Intellectual Property.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> We may make available through the Services content or data that is subject to our or third parties’ intellectual property rights.
We and our licensors retain all rights to that content or data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Section 8<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> has to do with Apps.
Under Section 8(a), we give you a right to use Apps (other than those you get from the Apple App Store or use on an Apple device) only for your personal (not money-making) use.
Section 8(b) includes several additional restrictions and limitations applicable to App Store Apps or Apps used on iOS and allows Apple to enforce these Terms against you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>(b)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Additional Information: Apple App Store.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> This Section 8(b) applies to any App that you acquire from the Apple App Store or use on an iOS device.
Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App.
In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the App purchase price to you (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section ‎17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Neeva are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Santa Clara County, and you and Neeva each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The exceptions to that rule are claims that can be heard in small claims court and claims asking for an injunction.
Note that if you win in arbitration, we may be required to pay your legal fees, but if we win, you don’t have to pay ours (unless the arbitrator believes your claim was frivolous).
You and Neeva are also each waiving the right to assert a class action.
As always, we encourage you to reach out to us directly.

As limited exceptions to Section ‎17(a) above: (i)&amp;nbsp;we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>(d)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Arbitration Costs.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>(e)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Except as provided in Section ‎17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.
To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>(f) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Class Action Waiver<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
YOU AND NEEVA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

With the exception of any of the provisions in Section ‎17(f) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Entire Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Neeva and you regarding the Services, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Neeva and you regarding the Services.

You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Neeva’s prior written consent.
Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
Neeva may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Waiver of Rights<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
Neeva’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.

Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
