The Gist
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We (the folks at Automattic) are on a mission to make the web a better place.
We hope you love our products and services — from website publishing tools to ecommerce solutions to security backup systems to management tools for distributed companies to the next great idea that we haven’t even thought of yet — as much as we love creating them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services.

If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ve made these Terms available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license, which means that you’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use.

You can grab a copy of these Terms and other legal documents on GitHub.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Fees, Payment, and Renewal
a.
Automattic Fees
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Fees for Paid Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like WordPress.com plans, WooCommerce themes or extensions, Jetpack plans, Jetpack CRM bundles, VaultPress plans, Happy Tools, MailPoet plans, the Payments feature, WooCommerce Payments, Email, and domain registration and renewal (collectively, “Paid Services”).
By using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees.
Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees.
For recurring fees, we’ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.
For revenue-based fees — such as fees for the Payments feature — you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates.
Revenue-based fees are ongoing.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Taxes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (“Taxes”).
You’re responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases.
If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you’ve paid or will pay, you’re responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> If your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Automatic Renewal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed.
This means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or invoice you (in which case payment is due within 15 days) to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes.
By default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription to a WordPress.com plan, you’ll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period.
We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don’t inadvertently disrupt your access to our Services.
The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.
If you’ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for WordPress.com Paid Services by visiting your Manage Purchases page.
For more information about how WordPress.com subscriptions work, please see our Manage Purchases, Renewals &amp;amp.
Cancellations support page.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for WooCommerce Paid Services by visiting your My Subscriptions page.
For more information about how WooCommerce subscriptions work, please see our FAQs about WooCommerce.com subscriptions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the respective Service’s website or contact the support team.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You’ll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters) for any reminder emails we might send you before your Paid Services renew.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service’s website.
For example, you can manage all of your WordPress.com plans through your WordPress.com Manage Purchases page.
To cancel a WordPress.com plan, go to your Manage Purchases page, click on the plan you want to cancel, then follow the instructions to cancel the subscription or turn off auto-renew.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>For WooCommerce Paid Services, you can turn off auto-renew for each active subscription at your My Subscriptions page.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If auto-renew is successfully turned off, you’ll see the date on which your subscription expires.
If you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Fees and Changes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law.
This means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees.
If you don’t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>No-Show Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may have a “no-show policy” for some Paid Services that require your participation (for example, our Quick Start sessions).
For instance, this may mean that if you don’t show up or are late for a scheduled session, you’ll still be charged and won’t be entitled to a refund.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Refunds.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we’ll also provide refunds if required by law.
In all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
b.
Fees Collected by Website Owners
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Website owners can sell items (goods, content, services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or simply collect payments.
We’re not involved in a website’s subscription details or store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased).
If you buy items or subscriptions from a website, you’re making the purchase directly from the website owner, and they’re solely responsible for the items sold.
Please contact the website owner if you have any questions or complaints.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Automatic Renewal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Any recurring payments you make to a website owner (like a website subscription) are automatically renewed.
This means that unless you or the website owner cancels your website subscription before the end of the applicable renewal period, it will automatically renew.
Your recurring payments are renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period.
For example, if you select an annually renewing website subscription, you’ll be automatically charged by the website owner once each year.
You can view the renewal dates for your website subscriptions on your Other Site Payments page.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Cancelling Automatic Renewal of Website Subscriptions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You can manage and cancel your website subscriptions as described here at your Other Site Payments page.
Click on the payment you want to cancel and follow the instructions.
Repeat this process for each website subscription you want to cancel.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Refunds.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We’re not responsible for refunding fees paid to a website owner because those transactions are between website owners and their users.
If you’d like to request a refund, please contact the website owner.
If you have a complaint regarding a website owner, you can contact us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
6.
Feedback
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services.
When you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we’re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
7.

Specific Service Terms
a.
WordPress.com Websites and Accounts
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>WordPress.com enables you to create beautiful websites and blogs, and we would love for you to use it.
A WordPress.com account also allows you to sign into some of our other Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>WordPress.com’s basic service is free, and we offer paid plans that add advanced features like a custom domain name, extra storage, and access to premium themes.
We don’t own your content, and you retain all ownership rights you have in the content you post to your website.
However, be responsible in what you publish.
In particular, make sure that nothing prohibited (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appears on your website.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please let us know.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Your WordPress.com Website’s URL.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> If you create a website on WordPress.com, you get free use of an Automattic-owned subdomain, like yourgroovysite.wordpress.com or mollys.food.blog.
You must not engage in “domain squatting,” claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>License.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> By uploading or sharing Content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, adapt, publicly display, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving our products and Services and promoting your website.
This license also allows us to make any publicly-posted Content available to select third parties (through Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services.
You also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to “reblog” your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website, which the reblogging function on WordPress.com does automatically.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Removing Content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> If you delete Content, we’ll use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on WordPress.com, but you acknowledge that cached versions of the Content or references to the Content may not be immediately unavailable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Web Traffic.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may use a third-party service to measure WordPress.com’s audience and usage.
By having your website on WordPress.com, you agree to assign the traffic for your website to Automattic, and you authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf.
This means that your website’s traffic may be included under Automattic, your website may not receive credit for traffic in the respective reports, and you must not assign your website’s traffic to any other party.
If we require additional documentation to verify ownership of your website or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to provide it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Prohibited Uses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Your Content and conduct must not violate the WordPress.com User Guidelines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>HTTPS.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We offer free HTTPS on all WordPress.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via Let’s Encrypt.
By signing up and using a custom domain on WordPress.com, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant’s behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your website.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Advertisements.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> We may display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

f.
Ecommerce Services
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>There are certain features offered via WooCommerce, WooCommerce Shipping &amp;amp.
Tax, WordPress.com, and Jetpack that enable you to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.) or receive payments on your website, like WooCommerce Payments, Store, the Payments feature, and the Pay with PayPal block (collectively, “Ecommerce Services”).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you use Ecommerce Services, the terms in this subsection apply, along with the terms for any underlying Service that you use.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Your responsibilities.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You have control over your store, and with great power comes great responsibility.
You’re solely responsible for all of your ecommerce activities, including managing subscriptions for your website, managing your store, all applicable taxes and fees, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws (such as those relating to automatic renewal).
Among other things, this means that:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We’re not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You may only use Ecommerce Services for legitimate transactions with your customers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must accurately communicate transaction details.
set expectations appropriately.
and fulfill all promises, representations, or warranties you’ve made.
For example, if you’d like to offer subscribers a new post each week for contributing to your site via Payments, but aren’t sure if you’ll be able to post that frequently, you should be clear that weekly posts are a goal and not a guarantee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You’re responsible for the nature and quality of the products or services you provide, and for delivery, support, refunds, returns, providing any appropriate warnings and for any other ancillary services you provide to your customers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You’re responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including chargebacks and pricing questions.
You must provide contact information so customers can contact you with questions or complaints.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must maintain a fair return, refund, cancellation, or adjustment policy, and clearly explain how customers can request a refund.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You’re responsible for acquiring appropriate consent to submit charges through WooCommerce Payments on your customers’ behalf, giving customers confirmation or receipts for each charge, verifying customers’ identities, and determining a customer’s eligibility and authority to complete transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you believe that a transaction may be erroneous or suspicious, you should research the transaction and, if necessary, contact your customer before fulfilling or completing the transaction.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you have transactions with individuals (i.e., consumers), you specifically agree to provide consumer disclosures required by law, and to not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You’re financially liable for disputes (including chargebacks), refunds, reversals, or fines that arise from your use of Ecommerce Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must ensure that any information you provide about your business, products, and services is accurate, complete, and current.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree to promptly notify us via email if you receive any inquiry or action from a government or regulatory agency (such as the Federal Trade Commission or a state Attorney General) relating to your transactions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Prohibited Uses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You may not use Ecommerce Services for any unlawful purposes.
in furtherance of illegal activities.
or in a manner that is unfair, deceptive, exposes us or customers to unreasonable risks, or does not disclose important terms of a transaction in advance.
Among other things, this means that:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Ecommerce Services cannot be used in or for the benefit of a country, organization, entity, or person embargoed or blocked by any government, including those on sanctions lists identified by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you’re using Ecommerce Services on WordPress.com, you must observe all WordPress.com User Guidelines and Store Guidelines.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you’re using Ecommerce Services to sell CBD and other hemp-derived products via WooCommerce, you must follow the WooCommerce Guidelines for CBD and Other Hemp-Derived Products.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may terminate your access to our Services or force refunds (where possible) to your subscribers and customers without notice to you if we determine (in our sole discretion) that your use violates the Agreement, or if a payment processor or regulatory authority requires it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Fees and Negative Balances.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> In some cases, you pay us fees relating to the Ecommerce Services you use.
For example, the fee for the Payments feature is a percentage (which depends on your plan) of the revenue your website generates through the Payment feature, and when you use the feature, you authorize Stripe to direct payment of that percentage to us.
As another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, there are transaction fees and dispute fees.
Please note that we have no obligation to reimburse or refund these revenue-based fees when you issue refunds to your subscribers or customers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you have a negative account balance (for example because of fraud, chargebacks, or other operational issues) or we’re obligated to pay or collect any fees relating to your ecommerce activities or your use of Ecommerce Services, you’re responsible for those losses and fees, and we may collect payment for those losses and fees.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Tax Calculations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You’re responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your ecommerce activities and your use of Ecommerce Services.
You must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities if applicable, and if needed, tell your customers about any Taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices.
While some Ecommerce Services allow you to include sales taxes in transactions — for example, tax calculations may be provided by TaxJar — you shouldn’t rely solely on these features.
We work to keep our documents and tools up-to-date, but tax laws change rapidly.
and we can’t guarantee that tax calculations you receive through or in connection with our Services are complete and accurate.
Tax laws also differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be interpreted differently by different authorities.
We recommend consulting with a tax professional for your specific tax situation to assess the tax rates you should charge.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If we’re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on your ecommerce activities or your use of Ecommerce Services, you’re responsible for these Taxes, and we may collect payment for them from you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Third-Party Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> You may decide to use third-party services, like Stripe or PayPal to collect payment, TaxJar to calculate Taxes, or EasyPost to manage shipping.
Please note that WooCommerce Payments is powered by Stripe.
If you use WooCommerce Payments or any third-party services, some of your — and your customers’ — data may be submitted directly to or passed to the respective third party, and the respective third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies may apply.
For example, Payments requires a Stripe account to manage payments, and when you use Stripe, you agree to their terms and policies.
Please note that third-party services may also charge you fees to use or access their services, as Stripe does for Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’re not involved in these relationships, but may facilitate transactions or communication.
For example, we may, on your behalf, receive notices or forms relating to your Stripe account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Some of these third party services (like TaxJar, if you use Store) may be enabled by default, but you can disable them before launching your store if you don’t want to use them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>More on WooCommerce Payments Specifically.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> As part of WooCommerce Payments, we may use certain third parties to fulfill our obligations to you, including integrating with payment processing third parties.
You may be subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties, and using WooCommerce Payments means you agree to comply with those terms and conditions.
In particular, you cannot use WooCommerce Payments to enable any person (including you) to benefit from restricted businesses or activities.
If we use another third party to fulfill these services, you authorize us to share your payment method information with an alternative third-party payment processor that is or will be integrated into WooCommerce Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may refuse, condition, or suspend any transaction or account (including your use of WooCommerce Payments) if we believe you have violated this Agreement or that your activities or transactions expose you, us, or others to unacceptable risks, as determined by us in our sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You authorize us to share data relating to WooCommerce Payments with the applicable payment processing third party for their use in accordance with their privacy policy.
Please refer to our privacy policy for details on how we otherwise collect, use, and disclose data made available to us as part of WooCommerce Payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>More on Shipping Services Specifically.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Our shipping Services allow you to check shipping rates or buy shipping labels from certain mailing services, like UPS, USPS, DHL, and Canada Post.
We’re only an intermediary between you and these third parties.
we aren’t involved in any way with your product or its shipment.
We also don’t guarantee that the results you obtain from the use of these services (like rates, labels, or delivery timeframes) will be accurate or reliable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You’re solely responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, including domestic and international shipping and customs regulations and any regulations imposed by the mailing service(s) you use.
For example:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If you use USPS postage, you need to comply with their shipping restrictions and mailing standards, among others.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When using DHL’s services, you are responsible for compliance with all applicable DHL rules and terms, such as the DHL Express Terms and Conditions of Carriage.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In addition, you’re solely responsible for customs charges, import taxes or duties, and any other charges related to your shipments.
If we incur any charges as a result of your use of the shipping services, you agree to reimburse us for the full amount within 7 days.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In some cases, you may need to pay fees to the carrier directly, like if you use UPS shipping labels.
In other cases, you authorize us to charge you for the fees associated with each shipping label you create.
Each fee will be charged separately to the payment methods you provide in your WordPress.com account, which you can view and manage as described on the Payments Methods support page.
If you have multiple payment methods, you can select which should be used for the shipping label service.
If we’re unable to collect payment from you for these fees, you’ll be responsible for payment within 7 days.
please contact us to make payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Refunds for unused shipping labels must be requested (like so for USPS) in your store’s wp-admin within 30 days of creating the label.
Depending on your bank and the third party involved, it can take up to 45 days for your refund to be issued.
If you don’t receive your refund within this time frame, please contact us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may not transfer or sell postage and/or shipping labels to a third party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
