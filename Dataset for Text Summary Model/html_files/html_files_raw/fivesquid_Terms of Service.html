<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Seller will be notified by email when a Buyer orders a service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Seller must deliver their completed order within the timeframe specified in their service description.
Failure to do so will permit the Buyer to cancel the order and may adversely affect the Seller's ratings.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Seller’s ratings are calculated based on feedback received from Buyers, the number of orders completed/cancelled and delivery timeframes met.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Both the Buyer and the Seller have the option to cancel an order by mutual agreement.
This will have no negative effect on either party.
If the Seller alone decides to cancel an order, this will have an adverse effect on their rating.
The seller is not permitted to cancel an order without good cause.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Each weekly or monthly order is treated as an individual order to which the above terms for Handling orders and all other terms will apply.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Buyer can cancel the subscription at any time Should the Buyer seek to cancel an order that is in progress, they will need to cancel by mutual agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Only PRO Sellers can offer recurring (subscription) services.
These are services which can be offered to Buyers on a weekly or monthly recurring basis.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Recurring services are handled as individual orders, but the raising of a new order and payment takes place automatically either monthly or weekly , depending on when you placed your initial order.
For further information please refer to our FAQs.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The orders are handled in exactly the same way as regular orders and the above administration fee applies to each individual order.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Buyers can cancel a recurring order via the ‘My Orders’ section of their account.
This will cancel the ongoing orders, but not the order in progress.
To cancel this order you will need to cancel by mutual agreement with the seller.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Where the Buyer purchases a service that requires physical delivery, the Buyer will be required to provide a shipping address.
The Seller will be responsible for all shipping arrangements once the Buyer supplies the shipping address.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Where the Seller’s account has been disabled, they will be able to withdraw their revenues after a safety period of 45 to 90 days from the day of the last cleared payment received in their account.
This is subject to our approval, taking into account the nature of the breach/violation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>We reserve the right to put any account on hold or to permanently disable it due to account misuse.
