<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Commercial activities mean the offering, solicitation or sale of goods or services by anyone other than DeviantArt.
Commercial activities with respect to the arts are permitted for registered members acting as individuals, for small corporations or partnerships engaged primarily in art-related activities in which one or more of the principals is a registered member or for those seeking to retain the services or works of a registered member.
Commercial activities in the form of paid advertising on the Service are subject to the terms and conditions relating to the purchase of such advertising.
No other commercial activities are permitted on or through the Service without DeviantArt's written approval.
Any interactions with members of the Service with respect to commercial activities including payment for and delivery of goods and/or services and any terms related to the commercial activities including conditions, warranties or representations and so forth are solely between you and the other member.
Paragraph 9, above, of these Terms of Service specifically applies with respect to commercial activities.

Groups<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>As a registered member of the Service, you will also be able to participate as an administrator or member of a "Group" which is a set of user pages and applications formed for the purpose of collecting content, discussions and organizing members of the site with common interests.
Further information about Groups can be found in our Etiquette Policy.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You agree to participate in a Group on the basis of its own rules consistent with these Terms of Service, the conduct set out in paragraph 19, above, and such other rules created by us for Groups from time to time including with respect to the use of Groups for commercial activities.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As an administrator or participant in a Group you acquire no ownership rights over the Group, the Group applications provided by us or over the right to conduct the activities of the Group.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Any Content or Artists Materials submitted to a Group remain, as between the Group and the user submitting such content, the property of the person who submitted the content.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Groups are managed by registered members of the Service and not by us.
We are not responsible for the conduct of Group participants or administrators and will not interfere with the management or society of any specific Group or the rules it establishes for itself as long as they are consistent with these Terms of Service and our policies.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Groups may not be used to collect personal data about participants in Groups without the participant's express permission.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The Group application permits us to take appropriate action should intervention become necessary as a result of a violation of the Terms of Service or of any other of our policies.
We can remove a Group and the Group's privileges at any time at our discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The use in a Group name of trademarks or distinctive trade names of properties, goods or services is subject to objections from the owner of the marks and names.
DeviantArt will respond to such objections by requiring an appropriate change in the name of the Group.
The use of trademarks and trade names in Group names otherwise must be descriptive of Group activity or purpose.
To avoid confusion and animosity, Groups wishing to name themselves after trademarked properties must include a further description in its name of the type of Group it expects to be such as "Master Photoshop Tutorials" instead of simply "Photoshop."<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
