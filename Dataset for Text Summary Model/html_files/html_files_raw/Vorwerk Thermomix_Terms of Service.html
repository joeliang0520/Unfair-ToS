In the event, and for whatever reason, should the arbitration clause below be inapplicable, then you as the User consent to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in the State of California for purposes of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.
In addition, you acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement, which constitutes an unauthorized use of Vorwerk proprietary assets or information, will cause irreparable injury to Vorwerk, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and Vorwerk would not have an adequate remedy at law.
You therefore agree that Vorwerk shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this Agreement.
Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that Vorwerk post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Vorwerk to enforce any provision of this Agreement.
Any claim you might have against Vorwerk must be brought within two (2) years after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.
In addition, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this Agreement.
