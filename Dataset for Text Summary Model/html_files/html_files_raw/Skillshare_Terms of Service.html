You hereby consent to such removal and waive any claim against us arising out of such removal of any User Submission, whether it is your own or another user’s.
See “Copyrights, Licenses and User Submissions” above for a description of the procedures to be followed in the event that any party believes that a User Submission infringes on any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other proprietary right of any party.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>If You See Something That Infringes Your Copyright<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), we’ve adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement.
We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.
If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Service infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to Skillshare’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Identification of works or materials being infringed;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Skillshare is capable of finding and verifying its existence;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent.
Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>remove or disable access to the infringing material;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>terminate such content provider's access to the Service if he or she is a repeat offender.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.
If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Skillshare is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Skillshare may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Skillshare may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.
Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Skillshare’s discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please contact Skillshare's Designated Agent at DMCA@skillshare.com.
Alternatively, you may send a complete notice of copy infringement to the following address:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>Skillshare, Inc.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>Attn: Platform Operations Department<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>215 Park Avenue South, 11th Floor<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>New York, NY 10003<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Account Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The following terms apply to your use of the Service and any account that you may open or attempt to open via the Service:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The teacher is required to respect the privacy of the student.
The teacher has a limited license to use this information only for Skillshare-related communications or for Skillshare-facilitated transactions.
The teacher may use that personal information for no other purpose, such as sending unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions.
Without express consent from that person, you must not add any Skillshare misuse any student’s personal information.
Remember that you need to comply with all relevant legal rules when you use Skillshare.
This include applicable data protection and privacy laws which govern the ways in which you can use another Skillshare user’s information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Teaching or Participating in a Class<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>These Terms of Service and the Governing Documents are in addition to any agreements, releases or other documents (the “Class Agreements”) that a teacher and student may enter into in connection with a class, including any Class Agreements entered into through the Service.

Among other things, Skillshare cannot control (a) the provisions of the Class Agreements, (b) the accuracy or legality of the Class Agreements or (c) any party’s performance of its obligations under the Class Agreements.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Teachers may earn revenue by publishing classes or offering additional services through Skillshare.
To qualify for payments each month, Premium Members must have watched a minimum of 30 total minutes across all of your Premium classes that month.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

Payouts sent on the 16th of each month are for transactions that have occurred in the previous calendar month.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Monthly payouts begin the month following the month in which a teacher publishes their first Premium Membership class and receives a minimum of 30 total minutes watched by Premium Membership students.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Skillshare distributes at least 30% of its monthly recurring revenue from Premium Membership to Skillshare Teachers on a monthly basis.
The algorithm used to determine your monthly share is based primarily on your share of the total number of minutes watched on the platform.
The specifics of the distribution calculation are subject to change from time to time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Teachers have 30 days from the time at which a payment was or should have been made to report any discrepancies.
After 30 days, you have waived your right to dispute any payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Teachers and students agree that Skillshare’s sole responsibility is to process payments and pay out teachers in the proportions set forth above.
Skillshare is not party to any transaction between any student and/or teacher and cannot be held responsible for any issues arising from any such transaction.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Teachers are responsible for all income, sales, and other taxes associated with the fees they earn.
Skillshare teachers will receive the appropriate tax forms, such as a 1099 or 1099k, from either Skillshare or one of its payment partners.
Skillshare reserves the right to withhold any payment until it has received all tax identification information it requires to satisfy its obligations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Skillshare reserves the right to withhold or cancel payments to Teachers if it deems, in its sole judgement and absolute discretion, that the Teacher engaged in behavior that violated any part of this Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>Premium Referral Program<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>As a teacher on Skillshare, you may participate in our “Premium Referral Program” by referring potential students to the Service.
Under the Premium Referral Program, you will receive an award of $10 for each new user that visits Skillshare through your unique referral link and pays for their first month (or year) of Premium Membership.
Award payments are subject to forfeiture or clawback if the student disputes the credit card charge or otherwise violates the payment terms, or if the teacher is found to be in violation of our terms.
You will receive this reward within 50 days of the student paying for Premium Membership.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order to receive a Premium Referral Award, each of the following requirements must be met: (i) you must log in to your Skillshare account on the Service and locate your “Referral Link”.
(ii) you must share the Referral Link generated by Skillshare with friends, family, and followers.
(iii) a student who clicks your Referral Link must create a Skillshare account and make his first Premium Membership payment.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Cancellations and Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Skillshare is not responsible or liable for any refunds for Premium Membership, workshops, or other purchases on the Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Skillshare Premium Membership<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may participate in our “Skillshare Premium Membership” by subscribing to pay monthly or annual membership fees for unlimited access to “Membership Classes.” Membership Classes are online classes that are offered as part of Premium Membership at Skillshare’s sole discretion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Recurring Billing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The membership fee will be billed on the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month or year thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership.
We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership.
We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.
In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate.
For example, if you started your Premium Membership or became a paying member on March 31st, your next payment date is likely to be April 30th, and your Payment Method would be billed that date.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>No Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refund or credits for partially used periods.
Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have the benefits of your Skillshare Membership through the end of your current billing period.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Cancellations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may cancel your Skillshare Premium Membership at any time for any or no reason.
To cancel your recurring subscription, please visit your payment settings within your Skillshare account profile located at https://www.skillshare.com/settings/payments.
If you have canceled your Skillshare Membership, you will lose access to all Premium features and Membership Classes you enrolled into during your Skillshare Membership at the end of your billing period.
If you choose to sign back up as a paying member, your billing date will reset to the day you paid.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Free Trials<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of paid subscriptions for our Skillshare Premium Membership for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”).
Skillshare reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>For some trials, we will require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial.
At the end of such trials, we may automatically start to charge you for the applicable paid subscription on the first day following the end of the trial on a recurring monthly or annual basis.
When you provide a Payment Method, we will attempt to verify the information you entered by processing an authorization hold.
We do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold, but your available balance or credit limit may be reduced.
By providing your payment details in conjunction with the trial, you agree to this charge using such payment details.
If you do not want this charge, you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your payment settings within your Skillshare account profile located at https://www.skillshare.com/settings/payments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Price Changes<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service, or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Student Referral Program<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may participate in our “Student Referral Program” by referring potential students to the Service.
Under the Student Referral Program, you will receive an award (a “Student Referral Award”) of 1 free month of Premium Membership for each Qualified Student Referral (as hereinafter defined) redeemable only when you upgrade your Skillshare account to a Premium Membership.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In order to receive a Student Referral Award, each of the following requirements must be met (any referral for which all such requirements are met hereinafter referred to as a “Qualified Student Referral”): (i) you must log in to your Skillshare account on the Service and select the “Invite Friends” link.
(ii) you must share the link provided with friends via Facebook, Twitter or similar services, by copying and pasting the Unique Referral Link generated via the Service, by sending the Unique Referral Link in an email via the Services to your friends, or by using the other tools provided by Skillshare to share the Unique Referral Link with friends.
and (iii) a friend who clicks the Unique Referral Link must create a Skillshare account and successfully pay for the first month of Premium Membership that is not refunded.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right to suspend your account and remove referrals should we notice any activity we determine as abuse of the referral program.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Referral Awards Generally<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Satisfaction of a Qualified Referral (as hereinafter defined) and the Referral Award (as hereinafter defined) you receive will be reflected in your Skillshare account in a commercially reasonable amount of time after the Qualified Referral has been completed.

Referral Awards accrued in multiple Skillshare accounts may not be combined into one Skillshare account.
You may not earn Referral Awards by creating multiple Skillshare accounts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
