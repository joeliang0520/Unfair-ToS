This replacement address is shared with many other users, which not only protects each individual's user data but also hides his or her pattern of activity.
Therefore, the traceable chain between users and their online activity is broken.

We also hijack DNS requests (port 53) in order to prevent DNS leaks.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We do not block or filter domains except when requested by the owner of an IP address or when known botnet addresses cause our servers to be null-routed by hosting providers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
