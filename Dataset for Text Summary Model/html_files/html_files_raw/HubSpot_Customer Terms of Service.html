<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>PLEASE READ THESE CUSTOMER TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Our Customer Terms of Service is a contract that governs our customers' use of the HubSpot services.
It consists of the following documents:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Master Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>: These contain the core legal and commercial terms that apply to your subscription<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Product Specific Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>: These include any additional terms that apply to your use of each of our product offerings, our consulting and other services and third party services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Jurisdiction Specific Terms<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>: Depending on your location, some of these jurisdiction specific terms will apply to you.
They’ll also explain which HubSpot entity you’re contracting with and which laws will govern our relationship.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Processing Agreement (DPA):<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This explains how we process your data and includes the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>: This is the definitive rulebook setting out what you can and can’t do while using our products and services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Product Privacy Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>: This policy describes how we collect, receive, use, store, share, transfer, and process your Personal Data in connection with your use of the Subscription Service.
It also describes your choices regarding use, as well as your rights of access to and correction of your Personal Data.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Your Order Form<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;is the HubSpot-approved form created following your purchase of one of our products or services through our online payment process or via in-app purchase.
It contains all of the details about your purchase, including your subscription term, products purchased and your fees.
You’ll find your Order Form(s) in the Documents section of your HubSpot portal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ve aimed to keep these documents as readable as possible, but in some cases for legal reasons, some of the language is necessarily “legalese”.
By using the Subscription Service or receiving the Consulting Services, you are agreeing to these terms.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We update these terms from time to time.
If you have an active HubSpot subscription, we will let you know when we update the terms via in-app notification or by email (if you subscribe to receive email updates).
You can find archived versions of the Master Terms, Product Specific Terms, Jurisdiction Specific Terms and DPA here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
