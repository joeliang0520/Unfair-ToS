<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
SEGMENT SERVICES.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Segment offers a suite of Services for data integration, data governance and audience management, as further described below and in the Documentation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.1.
&amp;nbsp;Overview<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>Segment’s “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Connections<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” Service acts as a central hub for Customer Data, allowing Customer to collect Customer Data from its selected sources (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Sources<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”), such as its own or third-party websites or properties, and send the Customer Data to Customer’s chosen destinations (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Destinations<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”), such as Customer’s databases or its accounts with third-party applications or services, for Customer’s further use.
The supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the Documentation.
For Sources owned or controlled by Customers (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Customer Properties<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”), Customer enables the collection of Customer Data by implementing Segment’s JavaScript, SDK or other code (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Segment Code<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”) on such Customer Properties.
&amp;nbsp;As further described below and in the Documentation, Customer maintains control over which Sources and Destinations it uses with the Services, as well as the types and content of Customer Data it shares between its Sources and Destinations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.2.
&amp;nbsp;Additional Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
If included on an Order Form, Customer may also receive access to additional Segment services that may be used with Connections (e.g.
Personas or Protocols).
The features of any additional services are further described in the applicable Order Form.
For clarity, any additional services are considered part of the Services for purposes of this Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.3.
&amp;nbsp;Definitions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Customer Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means any data that Customer submits to the Services, including data that it collects from Customer Properties or retrieves from other Sources through the Services, including as may be incorporated in any Customer reports or output generated by the Services.
Customer Data does not, however, include any Segment or third-party templates, technology or data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Documentation<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means the end user technical documentation provided with the Services, as may be modified from time to time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Laws<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including those related to data privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Sensitive Personal Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means any of the following: (i) credit, debit or other payment card data subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>PCI DSS<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”), or other financial account numbers or credentials.
(ii) patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>HIPAA<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”).
(iii) social security numbers, driver’s license numbers or other government ID numbers.
(iv) any information deemed to be “special categories of data” of an EU resident (as defined in European Union Regulation 2016/679).
or (v) other personal or sensitive information subject to regulation or protection under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act or similar foreign or domestic Laws.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Service(s)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means the specific Segment proprietary hosted service(s) (e.g.
Connections, Protocols, Personas) specified on an Order Form, including any related Segment dashboards, APIs and Segment Code.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Usage Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>” means Segment’s technical logs, account and login data, data and learnings about Customer’s use of the Services (e.g., frequency of logins, volume of Customer Data collected or sent to Destinations).
&amp;nbsp;For clarity, Usage Data does not include Customer Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.4.
&amp;nbsp;Provision of the Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
The Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form (each, a “<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subscription Term<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”) unless otherwise specified in Section 2 (Service Plans and Beta Releases).
Customer shall purchase and Segment shall provide the Services as specified in the applicable Order Form.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.5.
&amp;nbsp;Access to the Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
&amp;nbsp;During the Subscription Term (as defined below), Customer may access and use the Services for its internal business operations, subject to this Agreement, the Documentation, and any scope of use restrictions on the applicable Order Form.
&amp;nbsp;This includes the right to implement Segment Code on Customer Properties in order to collect Customer Data for use with the Services.
&amp;nbsp;Access to the Services is limited to Customer’s employees and contractors acting for the sole benefit of Customer (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Permitted Users<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”).
Customer and its Permitted Users may need to register for a Segment account in order to access or use the Services.
Account registration information must be accurate, current and complete, and will be governed by Segment’s Privacy Policy (currently available at https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/).
Customer is responsible for any use of the Services by its Permitted Users and their compliance with this Agreement.
&amp;nbsp;Customer shall keep confidential its user IDs and passwords for the Services and remain responsible for any actions taken through its accounts.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.6.
&amp;nbsp;Use Restrictions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
&amp;nbsp;Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to): (a) rent, lease, provide access to or sublicense the Services to a third party.
(b) use the Services to provide, or incorporate the Services into, any product or service provided to a third party.
(c) use the Services to develop a similar or competing product or service.
(d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise seek to obtain the source code or non-public APIs to the Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to Segment).
(e) copy, modify or create any derivative work of the Services or any Documentation.
(f) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Services (including any reports or data printed from the Services).
or (g) publicly disseminate performance information regarding the Services.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>1.7.
&amp;nbsp;Storage and Processing of Customer Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span> &amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>During each Subscription Term, Segment may store certain Customer Data submitted from Sources to enable various features and functionality of the Services, including for “replay” and re-sending of Customer Data to Destinations at Customer’s direction.
&amp;nbsp.
Customer acknowledges that Customer Data transmitted through the Services may be stored and processed by Segment in the United States or in other countries as approved or directed by Customer (e.g., through Customer’s selection of a regional option through the Services).
&amp;nbsp;For clarity, nothing in this Section 1.6 prohibits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to Customer’s designated Destinations as part of the Services.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>

If Segment specifies that the modifications to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer’s next renewal or order and Customer notifies Segment in writing of its objection to the modifications within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice, Segment (at its option and as Customer’s exclusive remedy) will either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the Services for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Services, and, in any event, <hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">continued use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer’s acceptance of such updated version.</hypothesis-highlight>

Policy modifications will apply automatically on the effective date specified by Segment and the Customer objection procedures in Section 12.1 (Modifications to this Agreement) will not apply.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Scope of this Addendum<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>This Addendum applies to Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement, except that <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annex A <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>(EU Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by EU Data Protection Law and <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annex B <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>(California Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by the CCPA.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>5.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Role and Scope of the Processing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Segment will Process Customer Data only in accordance with Customer’s instructions.
By entering into the Agreement, Customer instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum.
Customer acknowledges and agrees that such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement.
and (b) to perform its legal obligations and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims in respect of the Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as directed by Customer through the Services.
The parties agree that neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated therewith.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>6.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subprocessing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data.
Segment:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(i) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor, imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Addendum.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(ii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;A list of Segment’s Subprocessors, including their functions and locations, is available at https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/ or such other website as Segment may designate (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subprocessor Page<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”), and may be updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this Addendum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer’s Segment Workspace.
Segment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable.
If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segment’s appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved.
If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>7.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Security<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment’s security standards referenced in the Agreement (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Security Measures<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Segment relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws.
Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Segment’s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law.
A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment’s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay.
Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident.
Without prejudice to Segment’s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents.
Segment’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c.
will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>d.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment’s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data.
(b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services.
(c) securing Customer’s systems and devices that it uses with the Services.
and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Data Subject Requests<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Segment shall upon Customer’s request (and at Customer’s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services.
If Segment receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>9.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>a.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all of the Customer Personal Data from Segment’s systems.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may retain Customer Personal Data if required by law, which data will remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>Annex A – EU Annex<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>1.

&amp;nbsp.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Subject Matter and Details of Processing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(i) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Segment will (taking into account the nature of the Processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Segment) provide Customer with reasonable assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations in respect of Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law, including Articles 32 to 34 (inclusive) of the GDPR, by (a) implementing and maintaining the Security Measures.
(b) complying with the terms of Section 7 of this Addendum.
and (c) complying with this <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annex A<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(ii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Segment will grant access to Customer Personal Data only to personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations.
Should an employee of a Customer seek to exercise their rights under EU Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in respect of any Usage Data that constitutes Personal Data then the Customer undertakes to inform Segment without delay and instruct their employee to contact Segment directly via privacy@segment.com or such other email address as directed at the time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Audits and Reviews of Compliance<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>To the extent applicable Data Protection Laws include a right for Customer to audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer will exercise such audit right, and Segment will fulfill its corresponding obligations, as follows: <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(i) &amp;nbsp.
Segment shall make available to Customer relevant information regarding Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under this Addendum in the form of Segment’s most recent ISO 27001, ISO 27017 or ISO 27018 certifications or similar audit reports (“Third Party Reports”) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(ii) &amp;nbsp;Not more than once per calendar year and at Customer’s expense, Customer may audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data for compliance with its obligations under this Addendum by submitting reasonable requests for information, including security and audit questionnaires.
Segment will provide written responses to the extent the requested information is necessary to confirm Segment’s compliance with this Addendum.
However, if the requested information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued within the 12-month period prior to Customer’s request and Segment confirms there have been no material changes in the interim relevant to Customer’s request, Customer agrees to accept such Third Party Report in lieu of a written response.
Any information provided by Segment under this Section 2.b.
constitutes Segment’s Confidential Information under the Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(iii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
If a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section 2.b., Segment may object to the auditor if the auditor is, in Segment’s reasonable opinion, not independent, a competitor of Segment or otherwise unqualified.
Such objection by Segment will require Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(iv) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer will promptly notify Segment of any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit and provide Segment any audit reports generated in connection with any audit under this Section 2.b., unless prohibited by EU Data Protection Law or otherwise instructed by a supervisory authority.
Customer may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting Customer’s regulatory audit requirements and confirming that Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data complies with this Addendum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(v) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer shall reimburse Segment for any time expended by Segment or its Subprocessors in connection with any audits under this Section 2.b.
at Segment’s then-current professional services rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request.
Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by any auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit.
Nothing in this Addendum shall be construed to require Segment to furnish more information about its Third Party Subprocessors in connection with such audits than such Third Party Subprocessors make generally available to their customers.
Nothing in this Section 2.b.
shall require Segment to breach any duties of confidentiality.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Segment may (taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Segment) reasonably assist Customer in complying with Customer’s obligations under Articles 35 and 36 of the GDPR, by (a) making available documentation describing relevant aspects of Segment’s information security program and the security measures applied in connection therewith.
and (b) providing the other information contained in the Agreement, including this Addendum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

&amp;nbsp;Data Processing Facilities.
Segment may, subject to Section 4.b., store and Process Customer Personal Data in the United States or anywhere Segment or its Subprocessors maintain facilities.
Subject to Segment’s obligations in this Section 4, Customer is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Services complies with any cross-border data transfer restrictions of EU Data Protection Law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Privacy Shield.
To the extent that Segment Processes any Customer Personal Data of individuals in the EU or Switzerland in the United States, then Segment shall protect such Customer Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles and Supplemental Principles of the EU-U.S.
and Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks (“<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>Privacy Shield<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>”).
If Segment is unable to comply with this requirement, Segment shall inform Customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>c.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Standard Contractual Clauses.
If Customer is established in the EU and transfers Customer Personal Data out of the EU to Segment in a country not deemed by the European Commission to have adequate data protection, and the Privacy Shield ceases to be a basis by which Customer may lawfully make such transfer to Segment under Chapter V of the GDPR, and no lawful alternative basis for such transfer applies, such transfer will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, the terms of which are hereby incorporated into this Addendum.
In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties agree that:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(i) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(a) Customer will act as the data exporter and (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>b) Segment will act as the data importer;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(ii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;for purposes of Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Data Subjects, categories of data, and the processing operations shall be as set out in Section 1.b.
to this <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annex A<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(iii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
for purposes of Appendix 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the technical and organizational measures shall be the Security Measures;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(iv) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
upon data exporter’s request under the Standard Contractual Clauses, data importer will provide the copies of the Subprocessor agreements that must be sent by the data importer to the data exporter pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and data importer may remove or redact all commercial information or clauses unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent beforehand;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(v) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be performed in accordance with Section 2.b.
of this <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Annex A<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(vi) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;Customer’s authorizations in Section 6 of this Addendum (Subprocessing) will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Segment of the Processing of Customer Personal Data if such consent is required under Clause 5(h) of the Standard Contractual Clauses;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(vii) &amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp.
&amp;nbsp;certification of deletion of Customer Personal Data as described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided only upon Customer’s request.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
