(“Agreement” or “Shopify Payments Terms”) between you (if your business
is a sole proprietorship) or your business (if you are signing up on
behalf of a corporation or other legal entity) (the “Merchant”, “you” or
“your”) and Shopify Payments (USA) Inc., organized under the laws of
Delaware with offices at 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, Delaware
19808 (“Shopify”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span> A.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Our Role<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
The Shopify Payments service (“Shopify
Payments” or the “Payments Services”) is a: (i) payment account
boarding.
(ii) payment underwriting.
and, (iii) payment data
transmission service that helps you integrate with a payment
processor (the “Processor”), as described more fully in this
Agreement.
The Payments Services may also apply to your use of
point-of-sale equipment (“POS Equipment”), subject to
availability and to your election to procure the same.
You
hereby appoint us as your agent to deliver information and
instructions on your behalf to the Processor.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Under the separate Shopify Platform Terms of
Service (the “Shopify
Platform Terms”), Shopify Inc.
provides you with its online
storefront, shopping cart, store management, marketing, and
other services (collectively, the “Shopify Platform Services”).
The Shopify Platform Terms are incorporated herein by reference
and by accepting this Agreement you are also accepting them.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Neither Shopify Inc.
nor Shopify Payments (USA) Inc.
is a
bank, payment institution, or money services business, but are
instead, respectively, a supplier of the Shopify Platform
Services supplied under the Shopify Platform Terms and of the
Payments Services under this Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The Processor<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
The Processor is Stripe, Inc., organized under the laws of
California, which is a technical
services provider and may offer the services as an agent of one
or more financial institutions in United States (each, a “Financial
Services Provider”).
The processing and settlement of
Transactions (as defined below) (“Payment Processing”) is
carried out by the Processor and any of the Financial Services
Providers under a separate Stripe Connected Account
Agreement,
including the United States Stripe Services
Agreement and the applicable
Financial Services Terms, and
to the extent you use a payment method that is subject to
additional terms, the Payment
Terms (collectively,
the “Processor Terms”).
By accepting this Agreement, you are
also accepting and agreeing to be bound by the Processor Terms,
which is the legal agreement between you and the Processor.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Shopify is not a party to the Processor Terms and is not liable
to you in respect thereof.
By accepting this Agreement and the
Processor Terms you are agreeing to the creation of an account
with the Processor for Payment Processing (the “Processor
Account”).
We reserve the right to change the Processor, subject
to the terms of our agreement with the Processor.
In the event
of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the Processor
Terms, this Agreement shall prevail, except in the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and the Processor Terms
concerning Payment Processing or the Processor Account, in which
case the Processor Terms shall prevail.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Processor’s role is to accept and process credit card, debit
card and other types of payments (collectively “Cards”) with
respect to sales of your products and services through
internet-based transactions (“Card Not Present Transactions" or
“CNP Transactions”).
If applicable, POS Equipment permits
transmission of data to the Processor from in-person,
point-of-sale transactions (“Card Present Transactions" or “CP
Transactions”), as well as manually entered transactions (“Keyed
Transactions”).
CNP Transactions, CP Transactions and Keyed
Transactions shall be referred to herein, collectively, as
“Transactions”.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Your Role<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>The Payments Services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Shopify hereby grants you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited,
revocable right to use the Payments Services (the “License”).
The License shall be for the term of this Agreement only.
Neither the License nor any other provision hereof shall grant
any rights in the Payments Services or other intellectual
property rights except the limited License of use set out above.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You shall not: (i) permit any third party to access the Payments
Services, including, but not limited to, your Shopify Admin on
our website (the “Shopify Admin”), except as permitted herein,
and to carry out Transactions.
(ii) create derivate works based
on the Payments Services.
(iii) copy, frame or mirror any part
of the content of the Payments Services, other than copying or
framing for your internal business purposes.
(iv) reverse
engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to
discover the source code or trade secrets for any of the
Payments Services.
or, (v) access the Payments Services in order
to build a competitive product or service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to
be billed for each Transaction or, as the case may be, on a
recurring basis, in compliance with applicable legal
requirements and Visa Europe Ltd., Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
Canada Inc.
and Visa International (collectively, “Visa”),
MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”), American

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>POS Equipment<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
If applicable, you may elect to purchase
POS Equipment from Shopify that will allow you to accept CP
Transactions and Keyed Transactions.
POS hardware may be
purchased on the Shopify hardware store located here:
www.shopify.com/pos/hardware
(the “POS Equipment Store”).
POS software may be downloaded for
iOS devices from the Apple App Store under the title “Shopify
POS” or “Shopify”.
Your use of the Shopify POS hardware and
software is subject to the applicable sections of the Shopify

The Payments Services support most
Payment Network Cards, including credit, debit, pre-paid, or
gift cards.
You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for the
use of the Payments Services.
You also assume sole and exclusive
responsibility for Transactions under the Processor Terms.
You
are solely responsible for verifying the identity of customers
and of the eligibility of a presented Card used to purchase your
products and services, and Shopify does not guarantee or assume
any liability for Transactions authorized and completed that may
later be reversed or charged back (see section D5 below).
You
are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back
transactions regardless of the reason for, or timing of the
reversal or chargeback.
Shopify or the Processor may add or
remove one or more types of Payment Networks or Cards, in their
sole discretion, at any time, without prior notice to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement.
Shopify’s Privacy Policy and
the Processor’s Privacy Policy contain important information
about the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal
information, as well as other important matters, and explains
how and for what purposes we and the Processor collect, use,
retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to
us.
You agree that Shopify’s Privacy Policy and the Processor’s
Privacy Policy may be modified at Shopify’s or the Processor’s
option, if necessary, and you will check each Privacy Policy on
a regular basis.
You also acknowledge that the Processor is
required to report your business name and the name of your

Addendum.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

data protection law, including the EU General Data Protection

the GDPR.
If we process any Cardholder Data on your behalf,&amp;nbsp;we
and you both agree that it is our intention that you shall be
the “data controller” and we shall be the “data processor” in
relation to that data, as those terms are defined in the GDPR.

given by you to us from time to time.
Additionally, you
acknowledge that the Processor and MaxMind, a fraud detection
service, each independently serve as “data controllers” with

such data.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We will provide you with reasonable co-operation and assistance
in relation to any complaint or request made in respect of any

providing you with details of the complaint or request, helping

relevant timescales set out in applicable data protection
legislation), and providing you with any personal data we hold
in relation to a person making a complaint or request (again,

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Shopify Payments Fees<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
You agree to pay the fees for
processing that are set out in your Shopify Admin, which are
incorporated herein by reference (the "Processing Fees").
Processing Fees shall be collected from you by the Processor on
our behalf in accordance with the terms of the Stripe Connected
Account
Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If applicable, fees for POS Equipment are posted here:
www.shopify.com/pos/hardware
and here:
www.shopify.com/pricing (the
“POS Equipment Fees”).
At our discretion, POS Equipment Fees
will be collected on our behalf by the Processor pursuant to the
Processor Terms or by such other means as we may prescribe from
time to time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Fees for Shopify Platform Services are collected by Shopify
pursuant to the Shopify Platform Terms of
Service (the "Shopify
Platform Services Fees").
Processing Fees, Equipment Fees, and
Shopify Platform Services Fees shall be referred to herein
collectively as the "Fees".<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You are obligated to pay all applicable taxes, fees and other
charges imposed by any governmental authority, including,
without limitation, any value added tax, goods and services tax,
harmonized sales tax and/or provincial or territorial sales tax,
on the Payments Services provided under this Agreement.
If you
are tax-exempt, you will provide us with an appropriate
certificate or other evidence of tax exemption that is
satisfactory to us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right to change the Fees at any time, subject to
a thirty (30) day notice period to you in accordance with
Section A18.
If you continue to use the Payments Services and
the Processor Services for such thirty (30) days, then you are
deemed to have accepted the change in Fees contemplated by such
notice.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any
penalties and fines imposed on you or on us by any bank, money
services business, payment network, financial institution, or
other financial intermediary resulting from your use of the
Payments Services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or
by such financial intermediary’s rules and regulations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Security Interest<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
As security for performance of your
obligations under this Agreement, you grant us a first priority
lien and security interest on all funds processed and deposited
into all Payout Accounts (as defined in the Processor Terms),
and any other bank accounts associated with your Shopify
Payments Account, and in any funds processed using the Payment
Processing services.
These security interests and liens will
secure payment and performance of all of your obligations under
this Agreement and any other agreements now existing or later
entered into between us and you, including, without limitation,
your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us.
You will
execute, deliver and pay the fees for any documents we request
to create, perfect, maintain, and enforce this security
interest.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Our Collection Rights<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
To the extent permitted by law, we
may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by
requesting that the Processor deduct the corresponding amounts
from the Reserve Account (as that term is defined below) or from
funds payable to you arising from the settlement of
Transactions.
Fees will be assessed at the time a Transaction is
processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for
such Transaction.
If these amounts are not sufficient to meet
your obligations to us, we may charge the payment method
associated with your Shopify Payments Account for any amounts
owed to us.
Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on
demand will be a breach of this Agreement.
You will be liable
for our costs associated with collection in addition to the
amount owed, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and
expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding,
collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a
principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement.
If
we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you
in advance.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts may be
charged with fees that are incidental to the collection of
delinquent accounts and chargebacks, including, but not limited
to, collection fees and convenience fees and other third-party
charges.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation
to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by
phone, as provided to Shopify by you.
Such communication may be
made by Shopify or by anyone on its behalf, including, but not
limited to, a third-party collection agent.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Reserves<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set
aside to cover chargebacks, refunds, or other payment
obligations under this Agreement (the "Reserve Account").
We, in
our discretion, will set the terms of your Reserve Account and
notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain
amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for a
Transaction are held for a period of time, or that additional
amounts are held in the Reserve Account.
We, in our discretion,
may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any
time, for any reason, based on your payment processing history
or as requested by our payment processors.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may require you to fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i)
any funds payouts made or due to you for Transactions submitted
to the Payments Services.
or, (ii) amounts available in your
bank account by means of ACH debit to your Shopify Payments
Account.
or, (iv) other sources of funds associated with your
Shopify Payments Account.
or, (iv) requesting that you provide
funds to us for deposit to the Reserve Account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You agree that: (i) you are not entitled to any interest or
other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve
Account.
(ii) you have no right to direct that account.
(iii)
you have no legal interest in those funds or that account.
and,
(iv) you may not assign any interest in those funds or that
account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Contesting Chargebacks<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
You or Shopify may elect to
contest chargebacks assessed to your account.
Shopify may
provide you with assistance, including notifications and
software to help contest your chargebacks.
We do not assume any
liability for our role or assistance in contesting chargebacks.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You grant us permission to share records or other information
required with the cardholder, the cardholder’s financial
institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any
chargeback.
You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with
complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result
in an irreversible chargeback being assessed.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If the cardholder’s issuing bank or the Payment Network does not
resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the chargeback
amount and any associated fees from you as described in this
Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for
mediating or investigating chargeback disputes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
