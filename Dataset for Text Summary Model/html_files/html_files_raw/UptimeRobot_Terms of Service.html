And, once a downtime is detected, it can notify the "user-defined contacts" with various methods (like e-mail, SMS, mobile push messages, etc.).
The monitoring methods include:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>HTTP(s)/website monitoring<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>Optional paid services such as extra monitors, lower intervals or SMS messages are available on the products (any such services, an "Upgrade").
By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay UptimeRobot the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service.
Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged or credited the new prorated amount for the current payment period and the new rate will apply on your next billing cycle.
UptimeRobot reserves the right to change the payment terms and fees upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to you.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Minimal Hardware and Software Requirements for Using UptimeRobot.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>UptimeRobot can be used with any operating system (including mobile) that can run a modern browser (IE8+, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Purchase Process<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>Services provided by UptimeRobot can be purchased through the "Upgrade link" that can be reached after logging in to the products.
The process works as:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You select the desired Premium Plan or the number of SMS messages<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Complete the payment with a credit card, debit card or PayPal<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>UptimeRobot sends an e-mail mentioning that the purchased service can be used<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Automatic Renewal.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>Unless you notify UptimeRobot before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you.
Upgrades can be canceled at any time in the My Settings section of your site's dashboard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Refunds<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;br&gt;</span>You may terminate your subscription to the Upgrade at any time and you will not be obligated to pay any additional fees for upcoming subscription renewal periods.
However, any subscription fees you have paid in advance will not be refunded unless there has been 10 days or less since the payment.
For payments made in the last 10 days or less, only those payments are refundable.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
