<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>During the Subscription Term, Customer can access its Customer Data at any time.
Customer may export and retrieve its Customer Data in a standard format.
Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case Qualtrics and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Customer Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Before the Subscription Term expires, if available, Customer may use Qualtrics’ self-service export tools (as available) to perform a final export of Customer Data from the Cloud Service.
Alternatively, Customer may request data export through support ticket.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>At the end of the Agreement, Qualtrics will delete the Customer Data remaining on servers hosting the Cloud Service unless applicable law requires retention.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In the event of third party legal proceedings relating to the Customer Data, Qualtrics will cooperate with Customer and comply with applicable law (both at Customer’s expense) with respect to handling of the Customer Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>as permitted under Sections 3.4(b), 7.3(b), 7.4(c), or 8.1(c) (with termination effective thirty days after receipt of notice in each of these cases), or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>immediately if the other party files for bankruptcy, becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or otherwise materially breaches Sections 11 or 12.6.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>a pro-rata refund in the amount of the unused portion of prepaid fees for the terminated subscription calculated as of the effective date of termination, and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>a release from the obligation to pay fees due for periods after the effective date of termination.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

Upon the effective date of expiration or termination of the Agreement:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Customer’s right to use the Cloud Service and all Qualtrics Confidential Information will end,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Confidential Information of the disclosing party will be returned or destroyed as required by the Agreement, and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>WARRANTIES<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Compliance with Law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Each party warrants its current and continuing compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to it in connection with:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>in the case of Qualtrics, the operation of Qualtrics’ business as it relates to the Cloud Service, and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>in the case of Customer, the Customer Data and Customer’s use of the Cloud Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Good Industry Practices.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Qualtrics warrants that it will provide the Cloud Service:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>in substantial conformance with the Documentation.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>with the degree of skill and care reasonably expected from a skilled and experienced global supplier of services substantially similar to the nature and complexity of the Cloud Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Remedy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Customer’s sole and exclusive remedies and Qualtrics’ entire liability for breach of the warranty under Section 7.2 will be:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the re-performance of the deficient Cloud Service, and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>if Qualtrics fails to re-perform, Customer may terminate its subscription for the affected Cloud Service.
Any termination must occur within three months of Qualtrics’ failure to re-perform.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>System Availability.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics warrants to maintain an average monthly system availability for the production system of the Cloud Service as defined in the applicable service level agreement or Supplement (“SLA”).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for Qualtrics’ breach of the SLA is the issuance of a credit in the amount described in the SLA.
Customer will follow Qualtrics’ posted credit claim procedure.
When the validity of the service credit is confirmed by Qualtrics in writing (email permitted), Customer may apply the credit to a future invoice for the Cloud Service or request a refund for the amount of the credit if no future invoice is due.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In the event Qualtrics fails to meet the SLA (i) for four consecutive months, or (ii) for five or more months during any twelve months period, or (iii) at a system availability level of at least 95% for one calendar month, Customer may terminate its subscriptions for the affected Cloud Service by providing Qualtrics with written notice within thirty days after the failure.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Warranty Exclusions.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
The warranties in Sections 7.2 and 7.4 will not apply if:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the Cloud Service is not used in accordance with the Agreement or Documentation,<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>any non-conformity is caused by Customer, or by any product or service not provided by Qualtrics, or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the Cloud Service was provided for no fee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Disclaimer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Except as expressly provided in the Agreement, neither Qualtrics nor its subcontractors make any representation or warranties, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, regarding any matter, including the merchantability, suitability, originality, or fitness for a particular use or purpose, non-infringement or results to be derived from the use of or integration with any products or services provided under the Agreement, or that the operation of any products or services will be secure, uninterrupted or error free.
Customer agrees that it is not relying on delivery of future functionality, public comments or advertising of Qualtrics or product roadmaps in obtaining subscriptions for any Cloud Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics will defend Customer against claims brought against Customer and its Affiliates by any third party alleging that Customer’s and its Affiliates’ use of the Cloud Service infringes or misappropriates a patent claim, copyright, or trade secret right.
Qualtrics will indemnify Customer against all damages finally awarded against Customer (or the amount of any settlement Qualtrics enters into) with respect to these claims.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics’ obligations under Section 8.1 will not apply if the claim results from (i) Customer’s breach of Section 2, (ii) use of the Cloud Service in conjunction with any product or service not provided by Qualtrics, or (iii) use of the Cloud Service provided for no fee.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In the event a claim is made or likely to be made, Qualtrics may (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Cloud Service under the terms of the Agreement, or (ii) replace or modify the Cloud Service to be non-infringing without a material decrease in functionality.
If these options are not reasonably available, Qualtrics or Customer may terminate Customer’s subscription to the affected Cloud Service upon written notice to the other.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

and <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> (2) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Qualtrics<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>BACKGROUND<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Purpose and Application.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> This document is incorporated into the Agreement and forms part of a written (including in electronic form) contract between Qualtrics and Customer.
This DPA applies to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics and its Subprocessors in connection with its provision of the Cloud Service.
This DPA does not apply to non-production environments of the Cloud Service if such environments are made available by Qualtrics, and Customer shall not store Personal Data in such environments.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Structure.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Appendices 1 and 2 are incorporated into and form part of this DPA.
They set out the agreed subject-matter, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data, categories of data subjects and the applicable technical and organizational measures.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>GDPR.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics and Customer agree that it is each party’s responsibility to review and adopt requirements imposed on Controllers and Processors by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“GDPR”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>), in particular with regards to Articles 28 and 32 to 36 of the GDPR, if and to the extent applicable to Personal Data of Customer/Controllers that is processed under the DPA.
For illustration purposes, Appendix 3 lists the relevant GDPR requirements and the corresponding sections in this DPA.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Governance.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics acts as a Processor and Customer and those entities that it permits to use the Cloud Service act as Controllers under the DPA.
Customer acts as a single point of contact and is solely responsible for obtaining any relevant authorizations, consents and permissions for the processing of Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, including, where applicable approval by Controllers to use Qualtrics as a Processor.
Where authorizations, consent, instructions or permissions are provided by Customer these are provided not only on behalf of the Customer but also on behalf of any other Controller using the Cloud Service.
Where Qualtrics informs or gives notice to Customer, such information or notice is deemed received by those Controllers permitted by Customer to use the Cloud Service and it is Customer’s responsibility to forward such information and notices to the relevant Controllers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>SECURITY OF PROCESSING<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics has implemented and will apply the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2.
Customer has reviewed such measures and agrees that as to the Cloud Service selected by Customer in the Order Form the measures are appropriate taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Personal Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Changes.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics applies the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2 to Qualtrics’ entire customer base hosted out of the same Data Center and receiving the same Cloud Service.
Qualtrics may change the measures set out in Appendix 2 at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.
Individual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>QUALTRICS OBLIGATIONS<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Instructions from Customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics will process Personal Data only in accordance with documented instructions from Customer.
The Agreement (including this DPA) constitutes such documented initial instructions and each use of the Cloud Service then constitutes further instructions.
Qualtrics will use reasonable efforts to follow any other Customer instructions, as long as they are required by Data Protection Law, technically feasible and do not require changes to the Cloud Service.
If any of the before-mentioned exceptions apply, or Qualtrics otherwise cannot comply with an instruction or is of the opinion that an instruction infringes Data Protection Law, Qualtrics will immediately notify Customer (email permitted).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Processing on Legal Requirement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics may also process Personal Data where required to do so by applicable law.
In such a case, Qualtrics shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Personnel.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> To process Personal Data, Qualtrics and its Subprocessors shall only grant access to authorized personnel who have committed themselves to confidentiality.
Qualtrics and its Subprocessors will regularly train personnel having access to Personal Data in applicable data security and data privacy measures.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Cooperation.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> At Customer’s request, Qualtrics will reasonably cooperate with Customer and Controllers in dealing with requests from Data Subjects or regulatory authorities regarding Qualtrics’ processing of Personal Data or any Personal Data Breach.
Qualtrics shall notify the Customer as soon as reasonably practical about any request it has received from a Data Subject in relation to the Personal Data processing, without itself responding to such request without Customer’s further instructions, if applicable.
Qualtrics shall provide functionality that supports Customer’s ability to correct or remove Personal Data from the Cloud Service, or restrict its processing in line with Data Protection Law.
Where such functionality is not provided, Qualtrics will correct or remove any Personal Data, or restrict its processing, in accordance with the Customer’s instruction and Data Protection Law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Export and Retrieval by Customer.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> During the Subscription Term and subject to the Agreement, Customer can access its Personal Data at any time.
Customer may export and retrieve its Personal Data in a standard format.
Export and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case Qualtrics and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Personal Data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Deletion.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Before the Subscription Term expires, Customer may use Qualtrics’ self-service export tools (as available) to perform a final export of Personal Data from the Cloud Service (which shall constitute a “return” of Personal Data).
At the end of the Subscription Term, Customer hereby instructs Qualtrics to delete the Personal Data remaining on servers hosting the Cloud Service within a reasonable time period in line with Data Protection Law (not to exceed six months) unless applicable law requires retention.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Customer Audit.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Customer or its independent third party auditor reasonably acceptable to Qualtrics (which shall not include any third party auditors who are either a competitor of Qualtrics or not suitably qualified or independent) may audit Qualtrics’ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics only if:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics has not provided sufficient evidence of its compliance with the technical and organizational measures that protect the production systems of the Cloud Service through providing either: (i) a certification as to compliance with ISO 27001 or other standards (scope as defined in the certificate).
or (ii) a valid ISAE3402 and/or ISAE3000 or other SOC1-3 attestation report.
Upon Customer’s request audit reports or ISO certifications are available through the third party auditor or Qualtrics;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>A Personal Data Breach has occurred;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>An audit is formally requested by Customer’s data protection authority.
or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Mandatory Data Protection Law provides Customer with a direct audit right and provided that Customer shall only audit once in any twelve month period unless mandatory Data Protection Law requires more frequent audits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Other Controller Audit.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Any other Controller may audit Qualtrics’ control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics in line with Section 5.1 only if any of the cases set out in Section 5.1 applies to such other Controller.
Such audit must be undertaken through and by Customer as set out in Section 5.1 unless the audit must be undertaken by the other Controller itself under Data Protection Law.
If several Controllers whose Personal Data is processed by Qualtrics on the basis of the Agreement require an audit, Customer shall use all reasonable means to combine the audits and to avoid multiple audits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Scope of Audit.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Customer shall provide at least sixty days advance notice of any audit unless mandatory Data Protection Law or a competent data protection authority requires shorter notice.
The frequency and scope of any audits shall be mutually agreed between the parties acting reasonably and in good faith.
Customer audits shall be limited in time to a maximum of three business days.
Beyond such restrictions, the parties will use current certifications or other audit reports to avoid or minimize repetitive audits.
Customer shall provide the results of any audit to Qualtrics.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Cost of Audits.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Customer shall bear the costs of any audit unless such audit reveals a material breach by Qualtrics of this DPA, then Qualtrics shall bear its own expenses of an audit.
If an audit determines that Qualtrics has breached its obligations under the DPA, Qualtrics will promptly remedy the breach at its own cost.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Permitted Use.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics is granted a general authorization to subcontract the processing of Personal Data to Subprocessors, provided that:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics shall engage Subprocessors under a written (including in electronic form) contract consistent with the terms of this DPA in relation to the Subprocessor’s processing of Personal Data.
Qualtrics shall be liable for any breaches by the Subprocessor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics will evaluate the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of a Subprocessor prior to selection to establish that it is capable of providing the level of protection of Personal Data required by this DPA.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics’ list of Subprocessors in place on the effective date of the Agreement is published by Qualtrics or Qualtrics will make it available to Customer, upon request including the name, address and role of each Subprocessor Qualtrics uses to provide the Cloud Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>New Subprocessors.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics’ use of Subprocessors is at its discretion, provided that:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics will inform Customer in advance (by email or by posting within the Cloud Service) of any intended additions or replacements to the list of Subprocessors including name, address and role of the new Subprocessor.
and<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Customer may object to such changes as set out in Section 6.3<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Objections to New Subprocessors.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If Customer has a legitimate reason under Data Protection Law to object to the new Subprocessors’ processing of Personal Data, Customer may terminate the Agreement (limited to the Cloud Service for which the new Subprocessor is intended to be used) on written notice to Qualtrics.
Such termination shall take effect at the time determined by the Customer which shall be no later than thirty days from the date of Qualtrics’ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor.
If Customer does not terminate within this thirty day period, Customer is deemed to have accepted the new Subprocessor.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Within the thirty day period from the date of Qualtrics’ notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor, Customer may request that the parties come together in good faith to discuss a resolution to the objection.
Such discussions shall not extend the period for termination and do not affect Qualtrics’ right to use the new Subprocessor(s) after the thirty day period.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Any termination under this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to be without fault by either party and shall be subject to the terms of the Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Emergency Replacement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Qualtrics may replace a Subprocessor without advance notice where the reason for the change is outside of Qualtrics’ reasonable control and prompt replacement is required for security or other urgent reasons.
In this case, Qualtrics will inform Customer of the replacement Subprocessor as soon as possible following its appointment.
Section 6.3 applies accordingly.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

45 GDPR, or where (ii) Personal Data of another Controller is processed internationally and such international processing requires an adequacy means under the laws of the country of the Controller and the required adequacy means can be met by entering into Standard Contractual Clauses, then:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics and Customer enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Customer enters into the Standard Contractual Clauses with each relevant Subprocessor as follows, either (i) Customer joins the Standard Contractual Clauses entered into by Qualtrics and the Subprocessor as an independent owner of rights and obligations (“Accession Model”) or, (ii) the Subprocessor (represented by Qualtrics) enters into the Standard Contractual Clauses with Customer (“Power of Attorney Model”).
The Power of Attorney Model shall apply if and when Qualtrics has expressly confirmed that a Subprocessor is eligible for it through the Subprocessor list provided under Section 6.1(c), or a notice to Customer.
and/or<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Other Controllers whose use of the Cloud Services has been authorized by Customer under the Agreement may also enter into Standard Contractual Clauses with Qualtrics and/or the relevant Subprocessors in the same manner as Customer in accordance with Sections 7.2 (a) and (b) above.

Appendix 1 to the DPA and, if applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses
Data Exporter
The Data Exporter is the Customer who subscribed to a Cloud Service that allows Authorized Users to enter, amend, use, delete or otherwise process Personal Data.
Where the Customer allows other Controllers to also use the Cloud Service, these other Controllers are also Data Exporters.
Data Importer
Qualtrics and its Subprocessors provide the Cloud Service that includes the following support: Qualtrics and its Affiliates support the Cloud Service data centers remotely from Qualtrics’ locations specified in Qualtrics’ Security White Paper (which is available upon request).
Support includes:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Monitoring the Cloud Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Backup &amp;amp.
restoration of Customer Data stored in the Cloud Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Release and development of fixes and upgrades to the Cloud Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Monitoring, troubleshooting and administering the underlying Cloud Service infrastructure and database<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Security monitoring, network-based intrusion detection support, penetration testing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
Qualtrics and its Affiliates provide support when a Customer requests support because the Cloud Service is not available or not working as expected for some or all Authorized Users.
Qualtrics answers phones and performs basic troubleshooting, and handles support tickets in a tracking system that is separate from the production instance of the Cloud Service.
Data Subjects
The Data Exporter solely determines the categories of Data Subjects which may include: employees, contractors, business partners or other individuals having Personal Data stored in the Cloud Service.
&amp;nbsp.
Data Categories
Customer solely determines the categories of data per Cloud Service subscribed.
Customer can configure the data fields during implementation of the Cloud Service or as otherwise provided by the Cloud Service.
The transferred Personal Data typically relates to the following categories of data: name, phone numbers, e- mail address, time zone, address data, system access / usage / authorization data, company name, contract data, invoice data, plus any application-specific data that Authorized Users enter into the Cloud Service.
Special Data Categories (if appropriate)
The transferred Personal Data concerns the following special categories of data: As set out in the Agreement (including the Order Form) if any.
Processing Operations / Purposes
The transferred Personal Data is subject to the following basic processing activities:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>use of Personal Data to set up, operate, monitor and provide the Cloud Service (including operational and technical Support)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>provision of Services;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>communication to Authorized Users<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>storage of Personal Data in dedicated Data Centers (multi-tenant architecture)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>upload any fixes or upgrades to the Cloud Service<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>back up of Personal Data<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>computer processing of Personal Data, including data transmission, data retrieval, data access<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>network access to allow Personal Data transfer<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>execution of instructions of Customer in accordance with the Agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
Appendix 2 to the DPA and, if applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses – Technical and Organizational Measures
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
The following sections define Qualtrics’ current technical and organizational measures.
Qualtrics may change these at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.
Individual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Physical Access Control.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>Unauthorized persons are prevented from gaining physical access to premises, buildings or rooms where data processing systems that process and/or use Personal Data are located.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics protects its assets and facilities using the appropriate means based on the Qualtrics Security Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>In general, buildings are secured through access control systems (e.g., smart card access system).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As a minimum requirement, the outermost entrance points of the building must be fitted with a certified key system including modern, active key management.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Depending on the security classification, buildings, individual areas and surrounding premises may be further protected by additional measures.
These include specific access profiles, video surveillance, intruder alarm systems and biometric access control systems.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Access rights are granted to authorized persons on an individual basis according to the System and Data Access Control measures (see Section 1.2 and 1.3 below).
This also applies to visitor access.
Guests and visitors to Qualtrics buildings must register their names at reception and must be accompanied by authorized Qualtrics personnel.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics employees and external personnel must wear their ID cards at all Qualtrics locations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Additional measures for Data Centers:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All Data Centers adhere to strict security procedures enforced by guards, surveillance cameras, motion detectors, access control mechanisms and other measures to prevent equipment and Data Center facilities from being compromised.
Only authorized representatives have access to systems and infrastructure within the Data Center facilities.
To protect proper functionality, physical security equipment (e.g., motion sensors, cameras, etc.) undergo maintenance on a regular basis.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics and all third-party Data Center providers log the names and times of authorized personnel entering Qualtrics’ private areas within the Data Centers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>System Access Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp.
Data processing systems used to provide the Cloud Service must be prevented from being used without authorization.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Multiple authorization levels are used when granting access to sensitive systems, including those storing and processing Personal Data.
Authorizations are managed via defined processes according to the Qualtrics Security Policy<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All personnel access Qualtrics’ systems with a unique identifier (user ID).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics has procedures in place so that requested authorization changes are implemented only in accordance with the Qualtrics Security Policy (for example, no rights are granted without authorization).
In case personnel leaves the company, their access rights are revoked.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics has established a password policy that prohibits the sharing of passwords, governs responses to password disclosure, and requires passwords to be changed on a regular basis and default passwords to be altered.
Personalized user IDs are assigned for authentication.
All passwords must fulfill defined minimum requirements and are stored in encrypted form.
In the case of domain passwords, the system forces a password change every six months in compliance with the requirements for complex passwords.
Each computer has a password-protected screensaver.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The company network is protected from the public network by firewalls.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics uses up–to-date antivirus software at access points to the company network (for e-mail accounts), as well as on all file servers and all workstations.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Security patch management is implemented to provide regular and periodic deployment of relevant security updates.
Full remote access to Qualtrics’ corporate network and critical infrastructure is protected by strong authentication.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Access Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Persons entitled to use data processing systems gain access only to the Personal Data that they have a right to access, and Personal Data must not be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of processing, use and storage.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As part of the Qualtrics Security Policy, Personal Data requires at least the same protection level as “confidential” information according to the Qualtrics Information Classification standard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Access to Personal Data is granted on a need-to-know basis.
Personnel have access to the information that they require in order to fulfill their duty.
Qualtrics uses authorization concepts that document grant processes and assigned roles per account (user ID).
All Customer Data is protected in accordance with the Qualtrics Security Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All production servers are operated in the Data Centers or in secure server rooms.
Security measures that protect applications processing Personal Data are regularly checked.
To this end, Qualtrics conducts internal and external security checks and penetration tests on its IT systems.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>An Qualtrics security standard governs how data and data carriers are deleted or destroyed once they are no longer required.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Transmission Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;Except as necessary for the provision of the Cloud Services in accordance with the Agreement, Personal Data must not be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during transfer.
Where data carriers are physically transported, adequate measures are implemented at Qualtrics to provide the agreed-upon service levels (for example, encryption and lead-lined containers).
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Personal Data in transfer over Qualtrics internal networks is protected according to Qualtrics Security Policy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>When data is transferred between Qualtrics and its customers, the protection measures for the transferred Personal Data are mutually agreed upon and made part of the relevant agreement.
This applies to both physical and network based data transfer.
In any case, the Customer assumes responsibility for any data transfer once it is outside of Qualtrics-controlled systems (e.g.
data being transmitted outside the firewall of the Qualtrics Data Center).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Input Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> It will be possible to retrospectively examine and establish whether and by whom Personal Data have been entered, modified or removed from Qualtrics data processing systems.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics only allows authorized personnel to access Personal Data as required in the course of their duty.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics has implemented a logging system for input, modification and deletion, or blocking of Personal Data by Qualtrics or its subprocessors within the Cloud Service to the extent technically possible.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Job Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> Personal Data being processed on commission (i.e., Personal Data processed on a customer’s behalf) is processed solely in accordance with the Agreement and related instructions of the customer.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics uses controls and processes to monitor compliance with contracts between Qualtrics and its customers, subprocessors or other service providers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>As part of the Qualtrics Security Policy, Personal Data requires at least the same protection level as “confidential” information according to the Qualtrics Information Classification standard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>All Qualtrics employees and contractual subprocessors or other service providers are contractually bound to respect the confidentiality of all sensitive information including trade secrets of Qualtrics customers and partners.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Availability Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp.
Personal Data will be protected against accidental or unauthorized destruction or loss.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics employs regular backup processes to provide restoration of business-critical systems as and when necessary.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics uses uninterrupted power supplies (for example: UPS, batteries, generators, etc.) to protect power availability to the Data Centers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics has defined business contingency plans for business-critical processes and may offer disaster recovery strategies for business critical Services as further set out in the Documentation or incorporated into the Order Form for the relevant Cloud Service.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Emergency processes and systems are regularly tested.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Separation Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Qualtrics uses the technical capabilities of the deployed software (for example: multi- tenancy, system landscapes) to achieve data separation among Personal Data originating from multiple customers.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Customer (including its Controllers) has access only to its own data.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Data Integrity Control.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
Personal Data will remain intact, complete and current during processing activities.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;u&gt;</span>Measures:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/u&gt;</span>
Qualtrics has implemented a multi-layered defense strategy as a protection against unauthorized modifications.
In particular, Qualtrics uses the following to implement the control and measure sections described above:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Firewalls;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Security Monitoring Center;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Antivirus software<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Backup and recovery<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>External and internal penetration testing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Regular external audits to prove security measures<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;‘personal data’, ‘special categories of data’, ‘process/processing’, ‘controller’, ‘processor’, ‘data subject’ and ‘supervisory authority’ shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;‘the data exporter’ means the controller who transfers the personal data;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>‘technical and organisational security measures’ means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data-processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter’s behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to forward any notification received from the data importer or any sub-processor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for sub-processing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that, in the event of sub-processing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses.
if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>any accidental or unauthorised access.

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>at the request of the data exporter to submit its data-processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for sub-processing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that, in the event of sub-processing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>that the processing services by the sub-processor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to send promptly a copy of any sub-processor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 6<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Liability<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or sub-processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub- processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub-processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub-processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 7<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Mediation and jurisdiction<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 8<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Cooperation with supervisory authorities<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2.
In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 9<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Governing law<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 10<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Variation of the contract<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.
This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 11<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Sub-processing<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.
Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub- processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.
Where the sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under such agreement.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.
Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year.
The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;em&gt;</span>Clause 12<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/em&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ol&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.
In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ol&gt;</span>
