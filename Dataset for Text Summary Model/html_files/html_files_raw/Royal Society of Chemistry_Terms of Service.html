<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Where Interactive Services are in use on Our Websites:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>please be mindful of your own safety and use your best judgment when submitting information and/or content, whether via a Contribution or otherwise to Our Websites.&amp;nbsp.
In particular we discourage divulging personal telephone numbers, email addresses and postal addresses or other information that can be used to identify or locate you in public areas of Our Websites&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>we may assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on Our Websites, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks.
However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on Our Websites, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>the use of any of our Interactive Services by children is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian.
If you permit your child to use a web enabled device to access or view any of our Interactive Services you are solely responsible for deciding whether the content is appropriate for that child to access or view.&amp;nbsp.
We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation (if undertaken) is not fool-proof.
Children who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
