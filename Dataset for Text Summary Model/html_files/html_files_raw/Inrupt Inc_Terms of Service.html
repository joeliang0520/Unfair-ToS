<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>.
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Inrupt and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Inrupt.
Both you and Inrupt acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Inrupt's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(b) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>Costs of Arbitration<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Inrupt will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
Inrupt will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(c) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>Small Claims Court.
Infringement<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
Either you or Inrupt may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts or any United States county where you live or work.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(d) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>Waiver of Jury Trial<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
YOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and Inrupt are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In any litigation between you and Inrupt over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>(e) <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;i&gt;</span>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/i&gt;</span>.
ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Inrupt is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;b&gt;</span>&amp;nbsp;<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/b&gt;</span></div> <p></p>

If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Inrupt to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Inrupt agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, or the federal district in which that county falls.&amp;nbsp;</hypothesis-highlight><span class="hiddenTag"><hypothesis-highlight class="hypothesis-highlight other-content">&lt;/p&gt;</hypothesis-highlight></span>
