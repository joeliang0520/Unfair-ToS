<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>You must be age 13 or older.
While we are thrilled to see brilliant young people take an interest in our Service, we must comply with United States law.
Stingle Photos does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.
If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User's account immediately.
If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older.
in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.
A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;li&gt;</span>Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
