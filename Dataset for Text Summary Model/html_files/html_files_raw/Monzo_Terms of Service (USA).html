You can also find information on using your Monzo account in the Help section of the app.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may block payments if:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Using your card abroad 🌏<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your Monzo card should work anywhere around the world that accepts Mastercard.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>When you use your card abroad, we may charge you for payments you make in a foreign currency.
You’ll find the fees in our fee schedule.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>What we will charge you for 💵<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The full list of charges are set out in the fee schedule.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Using your card at an ATM 🏧<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Your Monzo card may be used to withdraw cash from any ATM in the United States and abroad that accepts Mastercard.
We do not charge ATM fees, but some ATM operators do, even if you do not complete a withdrawal.
In those cases, the fee amount will be charged to your Monzo account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We maintain a partnership with some ATM operators that allows you to withdraw cash without incurring a fee.
You may find these ATMs here.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>You agree to us using your information 🗂<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>By accepting these terms, you agree to us using your information to make and receive payments on your account.
If you don’t want us to do that any more, we’ll have to close your account.
But we may keep your personal data and use it where we have lawful grounds to do so, including any records we need to keep for regulatory reasons (see our Privacy Notice).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Charges outside our control 😔<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges in relation to your Monzo account, which are outside of our control and not charged by us.
For example, other banks may charge you for sending money to your Monzo account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>When we offer rewards 🎉<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Sometimes we'll offer rewards for things like inviting friends to join Monzo.
We can withdraw or change these offers any time, without letting you know in advance.
You’ll only get financial awards once per action (for example, you’ll only get a bonus once per friend you invite).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Pots 🍯<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can set up a Pot in your Monzo app.
You can move money into and out of Pots in your Monzo account.
There are no fees, and no limits on the number of transfers you make.
You can create and use Pots to save money for different purposes.
Pots aren’t savings accounts, don’t have their own account numbers, and don’t earn interest.
The money in a Pot is protected by the same FDIC insurance that protects your Monzo account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can only add money to, or withdraw money from, a Pot through your Monzo account.
Money in your Pots won’t be included in your available balance, and you won’t be able to spend it.
If you find yourself low on money you can always move money from a Pot back into your main account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Money in a Pot is not part of your “available balance”, which you can see in the Monzo app, and is not available to pay card transactions, direct debits, or automatic or scheduled transfers.
Those transactions will be declined if there are insufficient funds in your main Monzo account, regardless of balances in Pots.
To access money in a Pot, you must first transfer the money from the Pot to your main Monzo account, which you may do at any time.
You should keep enough money in your main Monzo account to cover all anticipated expenses.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you switch on the “Round up transactions” feature, we’ll round your card payments up to the nearest dollar and automatically transfer the difference from your main Monzo account to your Pot.
You can only turn on this feature for one Pot at a time.
The “Round up transactions” feature won’t work if you don’t have enough money in your main Monzo account.
You can turn off the feature at any time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>You can close a Pot at any time after.
We’ll automatically transfer any money in the Pot back to your main Monzo account.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>If something goes wrong 🚑<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Please keep your phone with the app, card and PIN safe at all times.
If we discover any security issues affecting your account, we’ll contact you as soon as possible in the most secure way, using one of our usual channels (see ‘How we’ll contact you’ above).<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If you lose your card or see transactions in the app that look wrong, freeze your card in the app and tell us as soon as possible.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If there’s an unauthorized transfer, we’ll refund you any money if:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>A.
you tell us within two days (excluding weekends and holidays) of learning that your card or PIN were lost or stolen<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>B.
you tell us within 60 days of accessing your transaction history or statement that it appears someone made a payment without your permission.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We may not refund all your money if you delay telling us within the time periods in A and B above.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>We’ll also refund any money you lost due to our mistakes or inaccuracies with your payments.
We can help by speaking to other banks to make sure they treat any payment we send late as if it was sent on time.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>But you won't be able to claim back money you've lost if:<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>A.
you gave us incorrect instructions or we can prove that the bank we sent your payment to received it (although we'll still try to help you recover your money)<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>B.
you gave your card or PIN to someone else<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>C.
you acted fraudulently.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If someone pays money into your account by mistake we will let you know if we return it.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>
<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>Closing your account 🙅‍♀️<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>
