Confidentiality13.1 Confidential Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>From time to time, either party to these Terms (the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Disclosing Party"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) may disclose or make available to the other (the <span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>"Receiving Party"<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>) non-public, proprietary, or confidential information of the Disclosing Party (<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;strong&gt;</span>“Confidential Information”<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/strong&gt;</span>).
Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information.
Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this Section 13.
(ii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information.
(iii) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure thereof.
or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>13.2 Protection and Use of Confidential Information<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>The Receiving Party shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Receiving Party would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially-reasonable degree of care.
(ii) only use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and only permit it to be accessed or used, for the purpose of exercising its rights or performing its obligations under these Terms, for the purpose of exploring a business relationship (or changes to the business relationship) between the parties, or for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy.
and (iii) not disclose any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Receiving Party's service providers or financial/legal advisors who need to know the Confidential Information and are bound to confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in these Terms.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>13.3 Compelled Access or Disclosure<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>13.4 Injunctive Relief<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;p&gt;</span>Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach.
Therefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>14.

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

(b) access to or use of our Service, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us.

JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available.
In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement shall control.
The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S.
county where you live or San Francisco, California, unless you and we agree otherwise.
If you are using Airtable for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
If you are an individual using Airtable for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS.
(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.
and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.
Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
You and we agree that the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, is unconscionable or illusory or any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.<span class="hiddenTag">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).
ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
