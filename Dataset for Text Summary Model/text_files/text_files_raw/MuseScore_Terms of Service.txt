PRO Access includes the following features and/or scores (Â«ItemsÂ»):</p>
<p>Scores made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted community of&nbsp;musicians.
When a&nbsp;user gets the PRO Access on&nbsp;any sheet music using PRO Credit, the user will receive unlimited lifetime access to this score.
User can still delete his or&nbsp;her account.
In&nbsp;that case, the user is responsible for downloading music scores.</p>
<p>PRO Access features include, but not limited&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>in&nbsp;App: mixer, transpose to&nbsp;any tonality, keyboard, autoscroll, offline access, download in&nbsp;PDF, MIDI&nbsp;or MP3.

Download could be&nbsp;restricted for some scores.</li>
<li>Features are subject to&nbsp;change.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>WE&nbsp;MAY AT&nbsp;ANY TIME IN&nbsp;OUR SOLE DISCRETION CHANGE OR&nbsp;REMOVE ANY ITEM WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED USING PRO CREDITS, AS&nbsp;WELL&nbsp;AS CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF&nbsp;PRO CREDITS NEEDED TO ACQUIRE A&nbsp;PARTICULAR ITEM.
You may only redeem PRO Credits for Items on&nbsp;offer at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;redemption.</p>
<p>PRO Credits cannot be&nbsp;purchased individually.
Users can buy a&nbsp;package, particular packages are available at&nbsp.
https://musescore.com/pro/landing/credits.</p>
<p>PRO Credits do&nbsp;not have any inherent monetary value and are not your own private property.
When you purchase or&nbsp;acquire the license to&nbsp;use PRO Credits, you do&nbsp;not own the PRO Credits.
Instead, they constitute an&nbsp;element of&nbsp;your license in&nbsp;the Service.
Similarly, any PRO Credits balance shown in&nbsp;your Account does not constitute a&nbsp;real-world balance or&nbsp;reflect any stored monetary value in&nbsp;any real-world currency.</p>
<p>Except as&nbsp;expressly stated in&nbsp;these Terms, items may expire.
Each item that you obtain using PRO Credits or&nbsp;points will be&nbsp;included in&nbsp;your account until the earlier of&nbsp;the itemâs expiration date, termination or&nbsp;expiration of&nbsp;your account, these Terms, or&nbsp;the Service.
Price and availability of&nbsp;items are subject to&nbsp;change without notice, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p>PRO Credit packages are valid for a&nbsp;fixed time period which is&nbsp;stated upon purchase.
Any unused PRO Credits will expire.
However, users can Â«top&nbsp;upÂ» their account and prolong the period.</p>
<p>Refunds are only available if&nbsp;a&nbsp;user contacts support in&nbsp;the first 14&nbsp;days after purchasing the PRO Credit pack.
The user can contact support for a&nbsp;pro-rated refund of&nbsp;unused PRO Credits.
For example, if&nbsp;the user bought a&nbsp;package of&nbsp;3&nbsp;PRO Credits and used 1&nbsp;one, then the user asks for the refund in&nbsp;the first 14&nbsp;days, the user can receive the difference between the price of&nbsp;the package of&nbsp;3&nbsp;PRO Credits and used PRO Credits.
After 14&nbsp;days from purchase, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not provide any cash or&nbsp;refunds for PRO Credits or&nbsp;Items (except as&nbsp;expressly required by&nbsp;law).</p>
<p>PRO Credits and Items do&nbsp;not have any real-world monetary value.
PRO Credits are for your personal use only and as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your Account with PRO Access.
You must not sell or&nbsp;transfer, trade, or&nbsp;exchange them (whether by&nbsp;itself or&nbsp;by transferring your Account) or&nbsp;make them available to&nbsp;anyone else or&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, or&nbsp;encourage anyone else to&nbsp;do&nbsp;any of&nbsp;these things.
PRO Credits and Items can never be&nbsp;redeemed for real world money, goods or&nbsp;any other item of&nbsp;monetary value, and cannot be&nbsp;inherited.
We&nbsp;may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of&nbsp;PRO Credits and Items.
For example, we&nbsp;may cap the amount of&nbsp;PRO Credits which can be&nbsp;acquired, held or&nbsp;redeemed in&nbsp;any particular period or&nbsp;we&nbsp;may impose restrictions based on&nbsp;your country of&nbsp;residence.
CERTAIN ITEMS MAY ALSO ONLY BE&nbsp;AVAILABLE TO&nbsp;SUBSCRIBERS.</p>
<p>FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF&nbsp;DOUBT, VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND PRO CREDITS HAVE NO&nbsp;CASH VALUE, DO&nbsp;NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY&nbsp;LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR&nbsp;REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF&nbsp;MONEY OR&nbsp;MONETARY VALUE FROM MUSESCORE AT&nbsp;ANY TIME, EXCEPT AS&nbsp;EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN.</p>
<p>MuseScore reserves the right to&nbsp;restrict access&nbsp;to, delete, reduce or&nbsp;liquidate PRO Credits: (1) if&nbsp;you have misused the PRO Credits.
(2) if&nbsp;you have breached or&nbsp;may breach any of&nbsp;these Terms.
(3) if&nbsp;the PRO Credits were awarded in&nbsp;error.
(4) if&nbsp;a&nbsp;payment for PRO Credits is&nbsp;charged back or&nbsp;otherwise cancelled or&nbsp;reversed.
or (5) if&nbsp;you have used PRO Credits to&nbsp;conduct any fraudulent or&nbsp;illegal activity.</p>
<p>MuseScore reserves the right to&nbsp;restrict access to&nbsp;or&nbsp;delete Items: (1) if&nbsp;you have misused the Items.

In&nbsp;addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or&nbsp;be&nbsp;consumed or extinguished in&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;your use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;MuseScore Product.</p>
<p>The existence of&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular Item available for licensing with PRO Credits is&nbsp;not a commitment by&nbsp;MuseScore to&nbsp;maintain or&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;make the particular Items available in&nbsp;the future.
MuseScore may revise, discontinue or&nbsp;modify Items at&nbsp;any time without notifying you.
