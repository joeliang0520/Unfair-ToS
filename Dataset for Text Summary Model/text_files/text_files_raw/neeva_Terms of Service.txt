 Updated: January 18th, 2022</p>
 Introduction<p>Terms of Service are long, legalistic documents.
Here are some important highlights from Neevaâs Terms of Service below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please donât abuse our Services.
We may cancel your account if you do so.<br>
</li>
<li>Our Free Basic Tier Services are currently free to use.
We also offer, for a fee, Premium Tier Services which include a range of additional benefits.<br>
</li>
<li>Only upload data that you have rights to.
We will use that data only in connection with our products or services or as directed by you.
For example, we might make copies and/or move the data around to provide services to you.<br>
</li>
<li>A search engine can be used for a lot of purposes: we are going to try every single time to show you great results (and never ads, or affiliate links), but we canât guarantee the quality of the results you get.
We suggest that you consult experts regarding important topics involving your health, money, legal matters, etc.
We are not your doctor, financial advisor, or lawyer.<br>
</li>
<li>Your data is yours.
We wonât sell your data or show ads on the Services.
Lawsuits are expensive.
To save you and us money, you are agreeing to settle disputes by arbitration.<br>
</li>
<li>Please read our privacy policy.
It provides important details about what data we collect, how we use that data, and with whom we share that data.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Weâve also included a âplain Englishâ summary before each section of the Terms.
While this Introduction section and those summaries arenât part of the Terms, we hope theyâll help you understand this important document.</p>Terms of Service<p>Please read these Terms of Service (the â<strong>Terms</strong>â) and our Privacy Policy (https://neeva.com/privacy) (â<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>â) carefully because they govern your use of the website located at https://neeva.com (the â<strong>Site</strong>â) and the proprietary software platform, including any associated mobile applications we may make available (â<strong>App</strong>â), web interfaces and browser extensions offered by Neeva, Inc.
(â<strong>Neeva</strong>â, â<strong>our</strong>â, â<strong>we</strong>â, â<strong>us</strong>â).
To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, our web interfaces and browser extension and App are collectively called the â<strong>Services</strong>.â</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S.
CUSTOMERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING, (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION), TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND NEEVA THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.

<p>
<strong>(c) </strong>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN NEEVA AND YOU.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Section 16</strong> states that any dispute between us will be decided under California law (and the Federal Arbitration Act) and that any dispute that isnât arbitrated will be heard in courts located in Santa Clara County, California.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>16.
Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section â17 âDispute Resolution,â the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Neeva are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Santa Clara County, and you and Neeva each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
<p>
<em>As stated in the Introduction, under <strong>Section 17</strong> you and Neeva are agreeing to submit any dispute to an arbitrator under the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
The exceptions to that rule are claims that can be heard in small claims court and claims asking for an injunction.
Note that if you win in arbitration, we may be required to pay your legal fees, but if we win, you donât have to pay ours (unless the arbitrator believes your claim was frivolous).
You and Neeva are also each waiving the right to assert a class action.
As always, we encourage you to reach out to us directly.
We want you to have a great experience!</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>17.
Dispute Resolution.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>(a) </strong>
<em>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</em>.
 
 We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, âDisputesâ) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.
 
 
 You and Neeva agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Neeva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
 
This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>(b) </strong>Exceptions.
As limited exceptions to Section â17(a) above: (i)&nbsp;we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.
and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>(c)</strong>
<em>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</em>.
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the âAAA Rulesâ) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms.
The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.
The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.
Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live unless we both agree to a different location.
The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>
<strong>(d)</strong>
<em>Arbitration Costs.</em> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we wonât seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.
If we prevail in arbitration, weâll pay all of our attorneysâ fees and costs and wonât seek to recover them from you.
If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneysâ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
<p>
<strong>(e)</strong>
<em>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</em>.
Except as provided in Section â17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that partyâs individual claim.
To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
<p>
<strong>(f) </strong>
<em>Class Action Waiver</em>.
YOU AND NEEVA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
Further, if the partiesâ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another personâs claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
<p>
<strong>(g)</strong>
<em>Severability</em>.
With the exception of any of the provisions in Section â17(f) of these Terms (âClass Action Waiverâ), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>Section 18</strong> is a miscellaneous collection of terms.
