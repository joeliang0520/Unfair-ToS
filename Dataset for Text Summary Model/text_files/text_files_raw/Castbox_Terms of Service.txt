Initial Dispute Resolution</b>
</p>
<p>We are available by email at the address provided in the âHow to Contact Usâ Section to address any concerns a user may have regarding the Service.
Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
For any dispute you have with the Company, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
We each agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with, or relating to this Agreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(2)&nbsp.
Agreement to Binding Arbitration</b>
</p>
<p>If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to section âInitial Dispute Resolutionâ above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.</p>
<br>
<p>All claims arising out of or relating to these ToS (including its formation, performance and breach), the partiesâ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the âAAAâ), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these ToS, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these ToS is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitratorâs award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
The interpretation and enforcement of these ToS shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

THE ARBITRATION RULES ALSO PERMIT YOU TO RECOVER ATTORNEYâS FEES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.</b>

<br>
<p>
<b>THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT, ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

<p>You and the Company each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and the Company each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.
If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section âAgreement to Binding Arbitration Aboveâ shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>(4)&nbsp.
