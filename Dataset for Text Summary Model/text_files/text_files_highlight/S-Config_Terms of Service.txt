 Why do you have a .onion site?!? It doesnât need to be on the dark web!<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Reinforcement of our statements within this very FAQ and also discussed on the Tor article published a while back.
We mean what we say when it comes to keeping the anonymity of our readers.
We view having a .onion domain in the same respects that Facebook has one which is <em>âaccessibilityâ</em>.
We see what is going on in other big brother government countries on how they are blocking off entire sites.
We do not care who reads our blogs and articles.
If having a .onion address means getting one percent more readership then it is a win in our eyes.</p>
