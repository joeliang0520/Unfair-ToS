 Subscription Service</strong>.
The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (â<strong>Subscription Service</strong>â).
If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Doist or its third party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums.
The â<strong>Subscription Billing Date</strong>â is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service.
For information on the â<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>â, please see our pricing page.
Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees and taxes for the next subscription period (e.g., monthly billing periods will be billed on the same day each month).
The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it.
You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account.
Doist or its third party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information).
You may cancel the Subscription Service by following the instructions provided at the following links for Todoist Premium, Todoist Business, and Twist, or by contacting us at support@todoist.com or support@twist.com (depending on which Doist Service product you are using).</li>
