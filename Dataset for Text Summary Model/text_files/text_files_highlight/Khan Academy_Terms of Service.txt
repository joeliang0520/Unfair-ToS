In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Khan Academy and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms ("<b>Dispute</b>") will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:</li>
<li>(b) Notice of Dispute.
In the event of a Dispute, you or Khan Academy must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a "<b>Notice of Dispute</b>").
You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S.
Mail to Khan Academy at P.O.
Box 1630, Mountain View, CA 94042 and also via e-mail to notices@khanacademy.org.
Khan Academy will send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class U.S.
Mail to your address if Khan Academy has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address.
You and Khan Academy will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.
After sixty (60) days, you or Khan Academy may commence arbitration.</li>
<li>(c) Binding Arbitration.

 >

You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules.
In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.
To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules.
The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.
The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</li>
<li>(f) Arbitration Fees.
Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.
If Khan Academy files, then Khan Academy will pay.
if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.
Each party will bear the expense of that party's attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</li>
<li>(g) Filing Period.
 
 To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding.
The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur.
If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</li>
 
 
 <li>(h) Venue.
In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4, you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and each of you and Khan Academy hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action.
Notwithstanding this, Khan Academy shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.

<li>15.6 Assignment.
The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Khan Academy's prior written consent, but may be assigned by Khan Academy without consent or any restriction.
Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be null and void.</li>
<li>15.7 Survival.
Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 through 6, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, and 8 through 15.</li>
