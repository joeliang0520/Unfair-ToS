 we strongly recommend the following minimum general privacy and security measures (among others) which are not specific to this website, if and to the extent that you wish to maintain your privacy: (1) use a proxy server that hides your actual IP address so that it does not appear in server log files.
(2) if you enable cookies which many websites require to operate properly (but which we do not currently and never have used, but which are used by third parties), you should erase them at least daily.
(3) use a browser that withholds the referring URL if you prefer this option.
(4) use a hardware stealth firewall.
(5) regularly use up-to-date virus checking, backup, and disk repair software.
(6) use security software that attempts to detect and prevent surreptitious capture and transmission of personal identifiers such as names, user-id's or numbers, e-mail addresses, unique machine specific identifiers such as your computer's permanent ethernet MAC (Media Access Control) address or cookie stored GUID (Globally Unique Identifier), or your actual IP address, (7) use high grade encryption for all private, if not all communications.
(8) never send confidential information or information not intended for publication using any e-mail link on this website.
(9) be aware that e-mail addresses appearing on websites are subject to abuse by spammers.
and, extremely important, (10) block all hosts that do not conform to your expectations of proper conduct.
