</p>What about Mobile Applications?<p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an âApp Storeâ).
Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below.
You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.
To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Use apply.</p>I use the Telly App available via the Apple and Android App Stores â should I know anything about that?<p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS and Android applications (the âApplicationâ) available via the Apple, Inc.
(âAppleâ) App Store and Google Play (âGoogle Playâ) Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:</p>

<p>(g)	You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third partyâs intellectual property rights, Telly, and not Apple or Google Play, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;</p>
<p>(h)	You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S.

In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (âClaimâ), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>
<p>â</p>

</p>
<p>â</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
</em>
</strong>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Telly and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Telly.
Both you and Telly acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Telly's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (âPersonnelâ) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>
<p>â</p>
<p>(a) Arbitration Rules.
Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.
If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, then, notwithstanding section (c), âSmall Claims Court.
Infringement,â ALL DISPUTES WITH TELLY ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, AND NOT BE A COURT OR JURY..
The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the âRulesâ) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.
Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>(b) Costs of Arbitration.
The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.
Telly will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.
Telly will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
</p>
<p>(c) Small Claims Court.
Infringement.
Either you or Telly may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Los Angeles, California or any United States county where you live or work.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.
YOU AND TELLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and Telly are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.
Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.
In any litigation between you and Telly over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND TELLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.
</em>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.
CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Telly is entitled to arbitration.
instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.
</p>
<p>(f) <em>Opt-out.
</em>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: support@freetelly.com within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.
You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Termsâ arbitration agreement.</p>
<p>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.
If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Telly to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Telly agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Los Angeles, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.
</p>
<p>(h)<em> Severability.</em> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.
This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Telly.</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>Miscellaneous.</em>
</strong> You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Telly may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.
